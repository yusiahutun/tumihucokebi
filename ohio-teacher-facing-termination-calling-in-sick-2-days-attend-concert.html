So wonders one Ohio teacher, who may have just rocked herself out of a job.</p><p>The teacher, Eileen Washburn, is currently on unpaid leave ahead of a vote to potentially terminate her employment from Lakota West High School on April 22.</p><p>According to the Lakota Local School Board, Washburn is under fire (and may be fired) under allegations she "falsified sick leave" on February 8 and 9 in order to attend a concert in Nashville, TN.</p><p>Per a copy of the resolution acquired by <a href=#><strong>The Cincinnati Enquirer</strong></a><strong> </strong>and first reported by<strong> </strong><a href=#><strong>Fox19</strong></a>, it was the district's interim superintendent, Elizabeth Lolli, who recommended that Washburn remain on suspension until the vote on her employment, or unless she requests a hearing.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a9660cdd-8a3f-4775-b2b1-9ff22f78b411 data-container-ref=toofab:article:c95ee9de-7de3-4201-8256-c5f281588c3c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/66/5by4/2023/12/29/6676c22ce35c43bab3019b886e41a02a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty Stock Image</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Man Refuses to Tell His Sister What Her Fiance Did on Bachelor Party</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The board reached the point of possible termination after Washburn refused to cooperate with their investigations during a "pre-disciplinary meeting." According to the board, she "refused to answer questions," regarding where she was or why she needed to ask for sick time.</p><p>"She informed several colleagues that she was attending a concert in Nashville, while taking sick leave from the District," the resolution reads.</p><p>According to the second-largest district in Greater Cincinnati, refusing to cooperate is a violation of her teachers union contract. Having taught English at the school since 2015, Washburn's term is set to expire at the end of 2025. She previously taught at Princeton High School from 2004-2015.</p><p>She is also a school board member for Loveland City School District, per the Enquirer. According to her biography on Loveland's <a href=#><strong>website</strong></a>, she has also worked as a yearbook advisor, government advisor, and varsity softball coach. She has two children.</p><p>According to the board's resolution, Washburn "violated O.R.C. §3319.141, Collective Bargaining Agreement Section 14.01(H), a number of Board Policies, including 3432 (Sick Leave) and 3210 (Staff Ethics). Her actions also violated the Licensure Code of Professional Conduct for Ohio Educators, specifically Principles 1 and 3. 4. Other good and just cause."</p><p>The latest post on the school district's <a href=#><strong>Facebook</strong></a> page, which is not about this matter, received several comments of citizens expressing displeasure. The page has 14k followers.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:c066e6d3-f307-4ef9-8c59-bb5ee32d940f data-container-ref=toofab:article:c95ee9de-7de3-4201-8256-c5f281588c3c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/92/5by4/2024/04/04/928c3f5646414694b395fa5cc19090d0_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Nickelodeon Host Marc Summers Walked Out Of 'Quiet on Set' Interview: 'They Ambushed Me'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In response to these off-comment posts, the district filtered them out on Monday and left their own comment, writing, "Some comments on this post have been hidden because they violate our Social Media Terms of User: The comments are unrelated to the original message and spirit of the post."</p><p>Responding to this comment, one citizen asked, "do you have another place where those comments can be made?" while another alleged, "They seem only interested in silencing those that disagree with them."</p><p>They were even more passionate on the school's <a href=#><strong>X/Twitter</strong></a> page, with one person responding to a <a href=#><strong>post</strong></a> about Paraprofessional Appreciation Day with the <a href=#><strong>message</strong></a>, "This is BS! Teachers get sick days. Eileen Washburn used hers for mental health purposes, and if you don’t think her reasons were mental health you need to visit the nearest classroom. This is invasion of privacy. I hope she sues!"</p><p>Another commenter shared the message "I support Eileen Washburn" on what appears to be her staff picture.</p><p>A post from April 2 about next month's Teacher Appreciation Week was deemed "ironic," amassing even more commentary. "How about appreciating your teachers by letting them use sick days for mental health days," <a href=#><strong>wrote</strong></a> one individual.</p><p>"Teachers get sick leave," another person <a href=#><strong>posted</strong></a>. "Most employers offer PTO, and I have NEVER been questioned how I use my PTO. Mental health days are important, too. It’s time you recognize that. Doesn’t sound like you appreciate teachers…at all."</p><a id=gallery-link-2f28f52a-f212-496a-97ca-90901db2defa class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:2f28f52a-f212-496a-97ca-90901db2defa data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:c95ee9de-7de3-4201-8256-c5f281588c3c data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/67/4by3/2024/04/08/67b425a249e5432aab4edec7329d820a_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21maXBfpLWqu4ytnJqbmJq%2FbrLAnKCnn12psrO5yKeYraGfo3qkrculoKefXZ67br%2FInKJmal2Zrrq%2FjJqrrZ2emXqku82cnKusXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nicholas-hamilton.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Nicholas Hamilton dating?
