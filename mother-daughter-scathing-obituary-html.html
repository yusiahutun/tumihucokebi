Lernel then had Gayle adopted by her 2nd husband, Frank Randall Cullum. They divorced after a decade of marriage - Gayle never heard from Frank again.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Heckman then dropped the bombshell that 'Lernal's 3rd husband, James Floyd Hart, sexually abused Gayle when she was 13. Instead of protecting her daughter, Lernal accused Gayle of "trying to steal her husband" and proceeded to beat her senselessly.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'After another divorce, Lernel acquired her 4th husband through the (unofficial or illegible) word-of-mouth inmate-run Jackson State Prison pen pal 'program'', the piece continued.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'In between and during her marriages, there were a variety of unsavory men in and out of our home.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'As a mother, Lernal was violent, hateful, and cruel. She physically, mentally, emotionally, verbally, and financially abused Gayle.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Lernell allowed for her many inappropriate suitors to sexually abuse Gayle. Lernel's abuse continued into Gayles's adulthood, attempting to physically, verbally, emotionally, and mentally abuse her in front of her children.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Gayle had to establish a no-contact order to protect herself and her family. That was 24 years ago.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said that in March of 2023, she unexpectedly found out who her biological father was 'through a popular online DNA service'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'After years of deception from Lernel regarding who Gayle's father was, Gayle and her family are navigating the waters of getting to know their paternal biological family.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'This is it. Lernal will never be the mother and grandmother that she could have chosen to be to her family. That door is closed forever with her death. That is what Gayle and her family grieve, who their mother and grandmother could have been.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'While they are afraid that Gayle, her husband, and their 4 children can not share their grief, their heartache lies with Lernal's brothers and sisters, their aunts, uncles, and cousins, as they grieve the death of a complicated family member, whom they love very much.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Lernal passed away December 12, 2023, in Three Rivers, MI, and will now face judgment.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Gayle and her family forgive Lernal and hope that she has found peace.

They all understand that the world is a much better place without her.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When the eye-popping obituary was published, it sparked a huge online reaction, leading the publisher to admit they didn't actually read it before allowing the piece to go to print.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It was submitted through our website, and was published without a good look on our part,' said Mike Wilcox, the publisher of Wilcox Newspaper.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We took it down from (the) website after complaints about its content poured in.
