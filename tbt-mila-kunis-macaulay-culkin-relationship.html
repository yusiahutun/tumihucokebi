The former flames were more than just child stars transitioning into the realm of adult actors together.

Still, Kunis gave us a glimpse into her relationship with the&nbsp;Richie Rich&nbsp;actor during select interviews. For a Hollywood couple, these two were extraordinarily ordinary.

"You know, I wouldn't take back anything in my life, not one thing. I think it all shaped me to be who I am today.
