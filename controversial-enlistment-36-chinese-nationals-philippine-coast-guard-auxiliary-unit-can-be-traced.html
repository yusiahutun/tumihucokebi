We went through intelligence and national security agencies of the [government], and we have delisted 36 of them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We did check on their compliance and standards set [for them], and we found out that they did not comply, so we initiated their delisting. They are now delisted.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gavan said volunteers were accepted into the PCGA “provided that they have secured national security clearance”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Congressman Robert “Ace” Barbers, however, remained concerned as he pointed out at the same hearing: “Are foreigners like the Chinese, especially the Chinese, allowed to become members of the auxiliary force of our coastguard?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“These Chinese served as auxiliary members of our coastguard for two, three years … They may be performing spying duties in the guise of being auxiliary force members.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The tiny island that embodies Manila’s David vs Goliath South China Sea struggle</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A source in the maritime industry, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told This Week in Asia the PCGA had existed as far back as 50 years ago under the rule of Ferdinand Marcos Snr. At the time, he said, Filipino and foreign yacht owners found it hard to register their yachts locally because the rules were the same for such vessels and for 20,000-tonne tankers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In other words, it would probably cost more than what you paid for the yacht to register. You also had to pay duties and taxes.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The source said this was why boat owners would register with the PCGA “because then they could paint a number on their boat that warned the Coast Guard they were a member of the auxiliary”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was simply to prevent extortion, the source said, while also accusing the PCG of being “corrupt” and having recruited former police officers who had been terminated by the force.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The source said there was speculation in the maritime industry that those who joined the PCGA could “basically buy their admiralty rank for a fee”, but added the donations went to the new recruit’s squadron to fund its programmes.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/02/27/clear.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:49</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Chinese floating barrier blocks entrance to Philippine ships at South China Sea flashpoint</p><p>Chinese floating barrier blocks entrance to Philippine ships at South China Sea flashpoint</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">PCG spokesman Rear Admiral Armand Balilo said the PCG had in 2018 publicly disowned an individual who was recruiting members for money. However, he said it was “not true” that dismissed policemen were being hired, adding it was his first time hearing such allegations of dismissed officers on the roster.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2019, according to a news release, then PCG commandant Joel Garcia swore in 110 former policemen and soldiers who had been “separated with honour”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Today, the PCG has a dual function. It is an armed and uniformed civilian agency whose commandant reports directly to the Department of Transportation and Communications secretary in peace time and to the defence secretary in wartime.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2009, the Coast Guard Law was revised and for the first time, it recognised the role of the PCGA as “a civilian volunteer organisation under the direct control and supervision of the PCG Commandant”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Among its functions were to “assist the PCG in the promotion of safety of life and property at sea. The preservation of the marine environment and its resources, the conduct of maritime search and rescue, the maintenance of aids to navigation and such other activities that enhance maritime community relations which include civic action”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/02/27/clear.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Balilo told This Week in Asia a number of foreigners had long been members of the PCGA, “some more than 20 years”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He recalled that the Chinese volunteers had been recommended for membership by Filipino-Chinese businessmen, and they had joined the PCGA Executive Squadron and Civil Relation Service Special Support Squadron. Based on its Meta page, the Executive Squadron appears to consist of prominent personalities who include politicians and government officials.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The [Chinese] submitted police clearance, National Bureau of Investigation [clearance], and I think passports showing [Bureau of Immigration] clearance.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He stressed that “their participation was limited to civic action like donation for relief goods and medical missions. They have no participation in any PCG operations and neither were they given access to the restricted areas in the [PCG] headquarters”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, when new PCG Commandant Gavan imposed an additional requirement for national security clearance, the mainlanders were apparently unable to submit that.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are very strict insofar as security is concerned,” Balilo said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/08/8ee097e8-4556-40b7-9cd7-f6be6906fbed_e3b9bbd6.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">‘No different from a rotary club’</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Balilo had said no PCGA member was involved in the recent hacking incidents that affected the PCG’s social media pages on Meta and X. He also said there was “no strong basis” to accuse them of spying.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Balilo placed the number of PCGA at around 20,000 volunteers now consisting of businessmen, government officials, youth and fishermen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“People who actually own boats are in the minority” in the PCGA, noted businessman Rafal “Apa” Ongpin, former president of the Manila Boat Club.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ongpin, however, saw no problem with foreigners, including Chinese nationals, joining the PCGA. “There’s no problem with that. It’s a civic organisation, they do charity drives. It’s no different from a rotary club.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/08/01bb6ba8-ddb9-4a94-bcef-00b6277cb33d_595de0ff.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The entry of more Chinese nationals into the PCGA could also be traced to former president Rodrigo Duterte’s pivot to China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During Duterte’s state visit to Beijing in 2016, he had committed to President Xi Jinping “to enhance cooperation between their respective coastguards”. Both had signed a memorandum of understanding on the establishment of a Joint Coast Guard Committee to “further deepen cooperation by conducting port visits, joint exercises, personnel exchange and training, and utilisation of hotline communication”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Two subsequent meetings of the joint committee produced two proposals – to put up a direct hotline between the two coastguards and for Manila to send a coastguard attaché to Beijing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, then Philippine foreign secretary Teodoro Locsin Jnr rejected the notion in 2020 with a warning that “a separate coastguard attaché means we concede exclusive sovereignty over our coastal waters so they are now subject to discussion instead of automatic protest”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2wuMitoJyrX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2JqhXN%2Fj2iaqKakp7y3sdGsoJqkXZq7rbXSraSepqRigHd5wqGgp52jmnqvrdOipqeZnKh6sbTIpaCpqJmjsm6vzpqqrWWXqq6zsIyarLGhnJ6us8WMrqWirF2Yrq95wZ5kraqRmLKl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-find-favorites-on-tiktok.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Find Favorites on TikTok</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bradley-cooper-irina-shayk-rekindle-pda-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bradley Cooper and Irina Shayk spark romantic reunion talk with sweet photos together</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
