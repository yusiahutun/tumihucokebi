When the Alexa app asks you to provide a sample of your voice, you'd think that meant it was ensuring only your voice (and the voice of other added users) will be recognized. But this isn't the case. While Alexa is technically designed to only respond to voices sampled through the app, that doesn't happen.</p><p>The next time you have someone around whose voice hasn't been sampled in the Alexa app, ask them to make a voice request. Chances are Alexa will comply like it would if it was you making a request.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is convenient for <a href=#>gatherings and parties using your Alexa</a>, as anyone can switch songs, ask a question, or adjust the volume. But responding to any voice also brings security concerns. If within listening range of your Alexa speaker, someone may be able to ring one or more of your phone contacts, send texts, and access other apps that you've linked to Alexa.</p><p>To prevent this from happening, it might be ideal for your Alexa to only respond to just you, or just trusted users. But is this possible?</p><p>It's not possible to ensure that Alexa will only ever respond to your voice. However, there are some things you can try to ensure your smart assistant responds to you and trusted users as much as possible.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-alexa-to-respond-to-you-and-trusted-users>How to Get Alexa to Respond to You and Trusted Users</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/alexa-white-echo.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Within the Alexa app for iOS or Android, there is a feature that allows you to create your own personal voice profile. You should be asked to do this upon app setup, but if this step didn't show up or you chose to skip it, you can still create a voice profile.</p><p>To do this, head to your Alexa app for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Android</a>, and then select <strong>More > Settings > Your Profile & Family > Voice ID</strong>. Here, you'll be able to see if you've already added any recognized voices. You can add your voice as the main user by clicking on <strong>Voice ID </strong>and then adding your voice sample. You can also delete your pre-existing voice ID and add a new one if you'd like.</p><p>In Voice ID settings, you can enable or disable the <strong>Personalize Skills </strong>feature, which allows third-party Alexa skills to distinguish whether it is you or someone else making a voice command. Activate this to ensure your skills also respond to you and trusted users.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If there is a voice added to your Alexa profile that isn't you, you'll be able to see the name of the profile next to the <strong>Your Family</strong> tab. You can also add more users by tapping on the <strong>Add Someone</strong> option in the same row. This will allow you to add another voice profile, perhaps of a relative, friend, or coworker.</p><p>Next up, you'll need to head back into your device settings, and scroll down until you see <strong>Wake Word</strong>. This feature allows you to set a specific trigger word to activate Alexa. You can choose from Alexa, Amazon, Computer, Echo, and Ziggy. Set your wake word to one of the lesser-known trigger words to make it harder for unauthorized individuals to activate Alexa.</p><p>You can also add a profile PIN to your Alexa app. This will cause Alexa to request a four-digit PIN for sensitive actions, such as <a href=#>buying products from Amazon via voice commands</a>, preventing unauthorized individuals from accessing private information or spending money without your permission.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To set up a PIN, head to <strong>More > Settings > Your Profile & Family > PIN. </strong>To create an Alexa PIN, you'll need to confirm your phone number by entering a confirmation code from a text Amazon sends you. You can reset the PIN whenever you'd like, but this will require another verification code that Amazon will send via text.</p><h2 id=make-sure-alexa-puts-you-first>Make Sure Alexa Puts You First</h2><p>While your Alexa speaker can respond to anyone, it's wise to put some protective measures in place to ensure it knows the main and additional users. Creating voice profiles, setting a different trigger word, and adding a PIN can all help your Alexa to personalize its functions to you and keep your device safe.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiamqZdrry2ecyom6KeqWKurbHXmmSrnaOlvK%2BwjKilpbFdrry2voyvpqKblWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lourdes-duarte-bio-wiki-salary-net-worth-wedding-husband-height.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lourdes Duarte</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ava-gardner-and-george-c-scott.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ava Gardner and George C.
