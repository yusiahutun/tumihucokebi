The extra-crispy texture produces a symphony of crunches that puts regular chips to shame. The hardy chips also hold on better to any seasoning so each bite is packed with flavor, and frankly, they just seem more “potato-y” than regular chips. We always feel like kettle chips are a healthy option, but how do they really compare to their standard cousins? Keep reading as nutrition experts reveal how healthy kettle chips are, plus find out how to make a good-for-you version right at home using a simple DIY recipe!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Are kettle chips healthy?&nbsp;</h2><p>Kettle-cooked chips are unique in their own right, but store-bought versions are still processed foods. With a brand like Lay’s, the nutritional values of their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">kettle-cooked chips</a> compared to their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">classic potato chips</a> are more alike than different. Here’s a breakdown of how one serving (about 15 chips) of the snacks stack up against each other.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Kettle vs regular chips: Levels of acrylamide</h3><p>Although both chip varieties are fried, the temperature-controlled frying process of kettle chips is what makes them extra crunchy and golden brown. “The potato slices are cooked in small batches in large, open kettles filled with oil at a lower temperature than traditional chips,” explains <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mary Sabat, MS, RDN, LD</a>, a registered dietitian and ACE-certified trainer. “This lower temperature allows the chips to cook more slowly and evenly, resulting in a thicker and crunchier chip.”</p><p>A common myth about kettle chips is that they’re more nutritious due to the low frying temperature producing less acrylamide, a chemical that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">forms in food during high-heating cooking</a> and can <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">negatively affect your nervous system</a> and has been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">linked to cancer in animal studies</a>. But extremely <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">high levels of acrylamide have been found in Kettle Chips brand kettle chips</a>, suggesting that kettle chips don’t come out on top here. <strong>It’s a draw.</strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Kettle vs regular chips: Calorie content</h3><p>Both types of chips are high in calories due to the amount of oil absorbed by the spuds. In fact, a serving of the brand’s kettle chips contains 150 calories, while the same amount of classic chips has 160 calories. This is something to be mindful of when deciding which snacks to munch on regularly as the calories can add up quickly. <strong>It’s a draw.</strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Kettle vs regular chips: Fat content&nbsp;</h3><p>In addition to increasing the chips’ calories, the frying process makes them high in cholesterol-raising saturated fats. The kettle chips contain 9 grams of fat per serving and a bag of regular potato chips has 10 grams of fat. Overall, the fat content of these chips make up over a third of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">22-gram daily recommended amount</a> for a 2,000-calorie diet. <strong>It’s a draw.</strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Kettle vs regular chips: Sodium levels&nbsp;</h3><p>A serving of the kettle chips contains 90 milligrams (mg) of sodium, whereas the sodium levels of the regular kind reaches 170 mg. Traditional chips being thinner than the kettle variety may cause them to absorb more salt and increase their sodium content. <strong>Kettle chips win.</strong></p><p>Ultimately, it’s best to treat commercial kettle chips like any other processed food: enjoy in moderation. However, if kettle chips are your go-to snack, making them at home is a quick and healthy alternative.

Below, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chrissy Arsenault, MBA, RDN</a>, registered dietitian at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AthleticMuscle.com</a>, offers four ways to create nourishing chips without skimping on flavor!</p><ul><li><strong>Don’t peel the potatoes.</strong> Potato skin is bursting with essential nutrients including fiber and iron to aid digestion and maintain healthy red blood cells. So keep the skin on to preserve the nutritional value of your homemade chips and save yourself prep time!</li><li><strong>Use these oils in place of the vegetable kind.</strong> Commercial kettle chips are often cooked in vegetable oil, which is a <a href=#>hydrogenated oil</a> full of saturated fats. Instead, cook the chips in healthy oils like olive or avocado oil as they contain rich fatty acids that help <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lower cholesterol levels and support heart health</a>.</li><li><strong>Forget frying and use these cooking methods instead. </strong>While the kettle frying process produces these chips’ signature texture, bake or air fry them to achieve a crunchy exterior with less fat. These cooking methods distribute heat evenly, which crisp up the chips without needing to use a ton of oil.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Mix up your seasonings. </strong>Although salt helps season the chips, avoid overdoing it to control the snack’s sodium content. Try sprinkling the chips with a small pinch of salt followed by herbs or spices to produce healthier and more flavorful chips.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A recipe for DIY kettle chips</h2><p>Arsenault’s foolproof recipe for kettle chips involves three core ingredients (potatoes, oil and seasonings) and only 30 minutes. What this approach leave out: the frying that produces acrylamide, hydrogenated oils, excess salt. Before you know it, you’ll have a delicious treat that’s good for you to munch on and share!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Healthy Kettle-Style Chips</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/Homemade-kettle-chips.jpg><p><strong>Ingredients:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>2 to 3 medium-sized russet potatoes&nbsp;</li><li>2 tablespoons olive or <a href=#>avocado oil&nbsp;</a></li><li>Salt, pepper, and your choice of herbs or spices for seasoning&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Directions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Active:</strong> 10 mins</li><li><strong>Total time:</strong> 25 to 30 mins</li><li><strong>Yield:</strong>&nbsp;3 to 4 servings</li></ul><li>Preheat oven to 400°F.</li><li>Wash and scrub potatoes thoroughly.
