Mclaughlin was born on 7th August 1999, making her 22 years as of 2021. She grew up in Dunellen, New Jersey and attended Union Catholic Regional High School. Despite being an excellent student, her interest lay in athletics, which is not surprising given that she came from a family of sportspeople – parents and siblings were track athletes.</p><p class=align-left>Mclaughlin took up competitive track sports at an early age. At just 14 years, she was competing in the under-20 national junior championships. In 2014, she finished second in 400-metres hurdles and set a record for both world age best (14 years) and national high school freshman.</p><p class=align-left>She continued competing in<a href=#> high school</a>, and her improved performance saw her qualify for the IAAF World Youth Championships in 2015 hosted in Colombia, where she won gold. In 2015, she qualified for the Rio Olympics, becoming one of the youngest athletes to represent the American Team in track and field. She managed to advance to the semi-finals in Rio but could not earn a place in the finals of the 400-metres hurdles.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8baa2b427f746edf.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lizzie Broadway: boyfriend, family, career, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After Rio, Mclaughlin joined the University of Kentucky, competing for their track and field team. She was an impressive athlete, setting new records for the World Junior 400-metres and Collegiate and NCAA 400-metres hurdles events during her time at the institution.</p><p class=align-left>In 2018, while still at Kentucky University, Sydney Mclaughlin turned pro (thus forfeiting college competition) and signed a sponsorship deal with sportswear brand New Balance. In 2019, she competed in the IAAF World Championships in Doha, where she won a gold medal in the 4x400 metres relay and a silver medal in 400-metres hurdles.</p><p class=align-left>McLaughlin qualified yet again to represent the USA in the 2020 Olympic Games held in Tokyo, Japan.
