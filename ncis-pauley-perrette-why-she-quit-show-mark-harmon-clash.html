On the show, her character resigned after an assassination attempt, but according to multiple reports,<strong> the real reason she left was because she had falling out with series lead Mark Harmon.</strong></p><p id=eRGYhe3DqksH data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Where are the stars who left NCIS now?" class=hm-link href=#>Where are the stars who left NCIS now?</a></strong></p><p id=eqXtmb8tQS0T data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>5 shows to watch if you can't get enough of NCIS</a></strong></p><p id=eb1kdKSFiL3o data-wc=75>The two stars reportedly had a <strong>number of clashes behind the scenes in 2016 </strong>after the Gibbs actor brought his dog to set, where it bit a crew member leaving him needing 15 stitches. Tellingly, the pair did not share the screen together during Pauley's emotional final episode. Instead, Abby bid farewell to her other colleagues at NCIS HQ and simply delivered a letter for Gibbs and watched from the street as he read it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e9af8a8f3dda-pauley-perrette-ncis-7-z.jpg><p id=ec_PNXjRDVz3 data-wc=8><strong>Pauley depicted Abby Sciuto in the CBS&nbsp;drama</strong></p><p id=e1tAOg3IfIaw data-wc=67>In the days following the episode's broadcast, Pauley took to Twitter with a <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>series of vague tweets</a> which seemingly referenced the incident. The first read: "I refused to go low, that's why I've never told publicly what happened. But there are tabloid articles out there that are telling total lies about me. If you believe them? Please leave me alone. You clearly don't know me. (Sorry guys, had to be said)."</p><p id=eQYEqcuzDjI7 data-wc=59>The following day, she added: "Maybe I'm wrong for not 'spilling the beans.' Telling the story, THE TRUTH. I feel I have to protect my crew, jobs and so many people. But at what cost? I don't know. Just know, I'm trying to do the right thing, but maybe silence isn't the right thing about crime. I'm... Just... ?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8242aa7e6bba-ncis-pauley-perrette-mark-harmon-5-z.jpg><p id=eUgLrGft8psg data-wc=12><strong>Pauley and Mark reportedly had a number of behind the scenes clashes</strong></p><p id=eOfNwIP9X2xm data-wc=104>She continued: "There is a 'machine' keeping me silent, and feeding FALSE stories about me. A very rich, very powerful publicity 'machine'<strong>. No morals, no obligation to truth, and I'm just left here, reading the lies, trying to protect my crew. </strong>Trying to remain calm. He did it." Perrette ended that stream of tweets with one final thought: "I've been supporting ant[i]-bullying programs forever. But now I KNOW because it was ME! If it's school or work, that you're required to go to? It's horrifying. I left. Multiple Physical Assaults. I REALLY get it now. Stay safe. Nothing is worth your safety. Tell someone."</p><p id=el3UOnfrTdoz data-wc=63>At the time, CBS released its own statement: "Pauley Perrette had a terrific run on NCIS and we are all going to miss her," it read. "Over a year ago, <strong>Pauley came to us with a workplace concern.</strong> We took the matter seriously and worked with her to find a resolution. We are committed to a safe work environment on all our shows."</p><p id=eS1PGDeGhEbZ data-wc=70>In 2019, Pauley again took to Twitter after receiving countless messages from confused and upset fans, wondering if she would ever reprise her role in the much-loved procedural. She wrote: "NO I AM NOT COMING BACK! EVER! (Please stop asking?) I am terrified of Harmon and him attacking me. I have nightmares about it. I have a new show that is SAFE AND HAPPY! You'll love it! #HappyPlace Love y'all!"</p><p id=eik_hg-yh4Ec data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="NCIS star Wilmer Valderrama say he can't leave home without special message from daughter" class=hm-link href=#>NCIS star Wilmer Valderrama say he can't leave home without special message from daughter</a></strong></p><p id=ec6lPuY5NXi1 data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>NCIS fans worry for Wilmer Valderrama's fate ahead of latest episode</a></strong></p><p id=e9pt-qTBrK1- data-wc=30>Pauley fired off another tweet - which has since been deleted - in which she again claimed that she was <strong>"physically assaulted"</strong> after trying to "protect" her fellow crew members.</p><p id=eisSr_fpniI0 data-wc=53><span>Following her departure, Pauley chose not to look for television work elsewhere and but did return to screens to star in the CBS&nbsp;sitcom </span>Broke<span>, where she played the lead role.
