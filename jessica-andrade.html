Jessica, who has been openly gay dated her partner for numerous years before she was ready to move to the next chapter of their life in 2017, the year she proposed to her girlfriend.</p><p>As a matter of fact, the engagement was a public announcement at the UFC 211 Women's Strawweight game held in Dallas where she was knocked out by her opponent, a fellow UFC female champ, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Joanna Jedrzejczyk</strong></a>. Although Andrade couldn't win the match, she still came out as the winner of the night.</p><h3>Andrade Publicly Proposed Gomez At The UFC 211 Game</h3><p>Speaking to the interviewer after the game, Jessica in her mother tongue expressed how she came to the ring to win but was still glad about the defeat claiming that she was in her early career. It was right after that, that the Parana native made the announcement of the proposal.</p><p></p><p>And, as the translator speaks, a loud cheer noise can be heard from the audience whilst Jessica blows a kiss to her then-newly fiancee who couldn't look happier from her seat as she receives congratulatory hugs.</p><p>Two years later, the lovely couple happily tied the knot in Las Vegas at the Graceland Wedding Chapel where Jessica looked smart in a blue shirt and pants accompanied by a black waistcoat whilst her wife made a great bride in an off-shoulder white gown.
