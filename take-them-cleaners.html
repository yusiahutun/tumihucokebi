Dry-cleaning can be expensive, but you do get what you pay for. As with many services, the more manual labour involved, the more expensive it becomes, and higher prices are charged according to the amount of hand-finishing involved. The bottom-of-the-line, often family-run, dry-cleaners that dot our streets with the same regularity of 7-Eleven convenience shops offer rock-bottom prices, but almost no speciality services and are mostly a laundry rather than a dry-cleaners. Since they often over-use their cleaning equipment to keep their costs down (for example, a 20kg machine is only supposed to hold 40 items of clothing, whereas these guys probably stuff the machines with 80 to 100 items of clothing), and so are best for larger, more robust items such as curtains, daily-use tablecloths and napkins and jeans that can handle a beating.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Top-end establishments, however (such as Jeeves, and The Valet at the Furama) oversee cleaning utilising professional-standard care and make it a point to talk to their customers, particularly where delicate fabrics and tricky stains are involved.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition, your clothes will be returned to you sans lint in pockets and dust balls that have gathered in the upturn of your cuffed trousers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Places such as Park Avenue, a newly opened establishment in Mid-Levels and Shouson Hill, strive to bridge the gap between high- and low-end cleaners. They offer the type of customer care that cheap and cheerful outlets compromise, and go out of their way to provide good service. They don't abuse their machinery by overloading it, and provide all services up to cleaning out your pockets. They have no problem referring customers to reputable dry-cleaners (like Jeeves and The Valet) if they feel unable to do a job properly, a practice most good cleaners who care about their customer base should adopt.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With this in mind, we went undercover and shopped around for the best dry-cleaning prices and services.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Our verdict: If an outlet is willing to chat with a potential customer on the telephone and not get irritated with a slew of questions, chances are it will take the time and discuss your needs with you in person. Almost all the shops reviewed provide same-day or express service, but always at a hefty mark-up.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">TOP END</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Valet at the Furama (basement, Furama Hotel, 1 Connaught Road Central, tel: 2525 5111) is a time-tested, dry-cleaning staple. If you drop off the clothing before 10am, you can pick them up again at 5pm - but at a price. It charges from $70 a shirt, but this will incur a 70 per cent mark-up if you want it cleaned the same day. Loyal customers are willing to pay the extra, and keep going back because it is famous for consistent quality and always getting it right.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jeeves of Belgravia (shop 2, Lobby Floor, Bank of East Asia Building, 10 Des Voeux Road, Central, tel: 2973 0101; 10 Yik Yam Street, Happy Valley, tel: 2574 9393; The Lee Gardens, 33 Hysan Road, Causeway Bay, tel: 2973 0077) handles corporate accounts for major fashion houses but doesn't offer same-day service. It is very professional, but here too you'll have to pay for the privilege (from $70 a shirt). It will de-pill sweaters and also offers free minor repairs such as mending small holes and re-attaching buttons - but don't send them your ripped jeans unless you're prepared to foot the bill.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">M?D-RANE</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Goodwin's of London (shop A, 2/F, Dairy Farm Shopping Centre, 35 Beach Road, Repulse Bay, tel: 2812 2400; Central Building, 1 Pedder Street, Central, tel: 2525 0605; Pacific Place, Admiralty, tel: 2918 1400) has slightly lower prices (from $54 a shirt) but markets itself as top-end. Same-day service (also with 10am drop-off and 5pm pick-up times) is offered at an extra 25 per cent on top of normal cleaning charges.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Park Avenue Clothes Care Specialist opened recently in Mid-Levels (33 Robinson Road, tel: 2536 9033) and Shouson Hill (16E Shouson Hill Road, tel: 2873 3986), and diligently keeps up with textile technology via the Apparel Research Centre to provide its customers with the most accurate cleaning methods around.

Shirts start at $38.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Clean Living charges $38 for a shirt with a 20 per cent extra charge for one-day service at its head office in Hung Hom (4 & 5/F, Eldex Industrial Building, 21A Matauwei Road, tel: 2333 0141/4), and 30 per cent extra for the Central, Causeway Bay and Admiralty shops (call head office for location closest to you).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Martinizing global chain (numerous locations; tel: 2526 7275) needs to work on customer service and has been known to provide inconsistent service. Its same day service requires a 9.30am drop off, with a pick-up after 6pm, and comes with a 20 per cent surcharge.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Out damn spot! Doing it yourself</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A variety of simple remedies for annoying stains live under the same roof as you do, making it cheaper and quicker to keep your clothes in tip-top condition. Here are some tips for at-home remedies and stain-free clothing.</p>The key to stain removal is not letting the offending area dry before you try to treat it. Immediate action is of utmost importance - stuffing items into the washing machine and expecting them to come out magically clean won't work. If you do this and notice the stains still haven't shifted, don't put them in the dryer. Doing so will only help to set the marks deeper into the fabric. For more information about stain removal - and deciphering confusing clothing-care labels - log on to <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">www.textileaffairs.com</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">PVC upkeep (accessories, shoes, trousers, jackets): Use a soft damp cloth dipped in mild detergent. Buff dry with a soft dry cloth. Do not wax. For a glossier finish, wipe milk on to the surface, and buff when dry.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Soy-sauce stains: Blot repeatedly with a light-coloured cloth to absorb as much of the stain as possible. Soy sauce sets with heat, so apply a stain remover and launder with cool water only. For old stains, a glycerin solution applied and left to sit for 20 minutes should work before washing as above.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sportswear: Special sportswear fabric is designed to remove perspiration from the body and evaporate quickly from the outside, and is treated with water-attracting molecules that conduct the moisture along the fabric's fibres outwardly. When drying, do not use dryer softening sheets or liquid softener, because they will destroy the moisture-control technology applied to the fabric.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Red/pink dye transfer: This is most apparent when you accidentally leave a red item in your lights and whites, but the evil red dye can also discolour greys and darker colours. Do not dry the clothes if you catch this mistake between the washing and drying cycles. Put them immediately back into the washing machine with some colour-safe bleach if the clothes are coloured - or add regular bleach to the water if they are all white - and they should come out their original colour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cooking oil splatters/spills: Sprinkle baby powder on to the stain, rub it in with some cold water, then wash as usual.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Perspiration stains: The zinc and aluminium content in anti-perspirants makes stain removal harder, and wearing an undershirt minimises marks on shirts and blouses. The sooner you notice any stains, the easier they will be to wash out. Old stains are difficult because of frequent machine drying. Treat fresh stains with ammonia, and old stains with white vinegar. Enzyme-type stain removers break down organic matter in man-made fibres, but would eat through natural ones such as silk and wool.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mildew: Mildew thrives best in warm, dark and humid places, and is extremely common here. To prevent it growing on your possessions, invest in a dehumidifier, wardrobe heaters and hanging sachets or boxes that contain moisture-absorbing chemicals. Leaving the air-conditioning on for extended periods of time is not wise either. The room may remain cool, but the outside heat combines with the colder interior will cause condensation, leading to mildew problems. Brush off as much mould as possible, and rub detergent into the dampened stain. Launder items in hot water, detergent and colour-safe chlorine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Blood: If you catch the stain before it dries, keep it wet. Rinse the area under cold water, then wash as usual. For old stains, soak garment for several hours in cool salt water, and wash as usual.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rings around collars and cuffs: Treat with shampoo, then wash as usual. Some sources recommend scrubbing the stains with a soft brush, but you should minimise any sort of scrubbing action, because this could set the stains deeper and weaken the fabric.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdjaYRzgY9oq5qjlWLBqbHMZpqlnZGjsrO%2F</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./454819-100-emotional-messages-birthday-wishes-family-friends.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>100+ emotional thank you messages for birthday wishes for family and friends</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./missing-who-was-john-tipton-a-19-year-old-missing-person-found-dead-what-happened.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>MISSING: Who Was John Tipton?
