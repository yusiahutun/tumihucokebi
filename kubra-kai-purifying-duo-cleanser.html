What do I mean by that exactly? We all know that Accutane causes a plethora of side effects for users who are looking to essentially permanently rid themselves of severe acne.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That said, adopting a post-Accutane skincare regimen was a top priority for me in order to not let all of my hard work go to waste.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I have found that the most important part of maintaining an effective skincare and beauty routine post-Accutane has mainly encompassed three key factors: not stressing out anytime a zit occasionally appears, applying SPF on a daily basis, and using a cleanser that agrees with my skin. For me, that has been the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Kubra Kay Purifying Duo Cleanser</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Long story short — this cleanser is my saving grace. It's powerful, yet gentle enough for my adjusting skin. The ingredients, which include glycerin and salicylic acid, are quality and don't interfere with many of the other skincare products I use. It's a perfect complement to the rest of my routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, I spoke with Khadidja Touré, Kubra Kay's founder, about the product development process, the story behind her brand, and the magic of the Purifying Duo Cleanser.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What went into the process of developing Kubra Kay's cleanser?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Purifying Duo cleanser was a year-and-a-half in the making. I knew that I wanted it to have the following components: Gentle enough for daily use, effective in removing makeup, dirt, etc., without stripping your skin; [and having] our staple vegan, cruelty-free, paraben-free, sulfate-free, mineral oil-free, and fragrance-free formula.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The cleanser was the hardest product for us to create to date. I wanted it to be unique because it had to be an actual staple product in a skincare routine, which meant that all of the components needed to be well-balanced. I selected and played with every single ingredient that went into the cleanser and was very involved with the lab. The first three versions of the cleanser were an absolute disaster until we got it perfect on the fourth try. I was very close to scrapping the entire project before I got the fourth version. I am really proud of how it turned out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some of the key ingredients include rose water for pH balancing, over five conditioning agents, lilac extract for anti-aging, ginseng extra for smoothing and balancing the skin, and salicylic acid to help remove dirt, bacteria, and grime.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$15; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">kubrakayskincare.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>You have mentioned that you've struggled with skin issues in the past. How did this influence the products you create?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I created Kubra Kay Skincare because I wanted to create a simple and effective routine for everyday people. My skin has always been horrific, and when I tried to invest and start taking care of my skin, the journey was discouraging and lacked results. The two most significant areas that would have made a difference when I was on my journey were better education on ingredients and product formulation and a better understanding of what realistic (unfiltered) skin was supposed to look like.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At its core, Kubra Kay Skincare is a people-inspired brand on a mission to help shape the perception of beauty and its effect on people's confidence. At Kubra Kay, we aim to redefine what healthy skin looks like while empowering our customers to make more informed buying decisions. We do this by educating consumers through our social pages and empowering consumers to care for and feel confident in their natural skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: "Slugging" Is TikTok's Favorite Cheap Skincare Hack for Ridiculously Soft Skin</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Can you describe why it is important to you to cater to people of all skin types who may be dealing with different issues?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It was imperative for Kubra Kay Skincare to be a brand that included varying skin types. It is extremely frustrating when you need products for your skin concerns, and there is a lack of representation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How do you think that your efforts as a beauty expert are helping to normalize "skin neutrality" as opposed to "skin positivity" in the beauty industry?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once you understand that people are posting the best of themselves — plus a little editing — you realize that you are comparing yourself to images that aren't realistic or even attainable. Acne, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation are typical, and part of your skin cycle. I try to normalize that by posting myself in those cycles. As a founder and skin enthusiast, I feel like I have an immense responsibility to show people the reality of my unfiltered skin regularly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1ooq6aopZ6rK3IZqeuqpmbxqq6xmabrqddmLmmrc2snKs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./6-female-celebrities-who-married-billionaire-businessmen-salma-hayek-and-kering-luxury-fashion-boss.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>6 female celebrities who married billionaire businessmen: from Salma Hayek and Kering luxury fashion</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sia-age.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sia Age, Height, Career, Relationships, Net Worth 2023, Ig</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
