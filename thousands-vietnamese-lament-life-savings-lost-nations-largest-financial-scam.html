The court has ordered the seizure of Lan’s properties for compensation, but it is unclear how much will be repaid to the victims.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Vietnamese banks are vulnerable to fraud and mismanagement due to complex rules applicable to their operations, according to financial experts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lan’s 160-page indictment attested to this with charges - mostly for corruption and violation of banking rules – levelled against 86 defendants including staff working at all levels of SCB and watchdog officials.</p>“It shows that <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">corruption</span></a> is endemic in Vietnam’s current institutional setting,” said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow at the Vietnam Studies Programme of the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Vietnam would not be able to tackle corruption effectively “without more rigorous reforms in the check-and-balance system and the accountability mechanism”, Giang said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The sky’s the limit?

Her fraud was facilitated by senior state officials, including a former inspector at Vietnam’s central bank, who was sentenced to life in prison for taking US$5.2 million in bribes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Before her arrest in October 2022, Lan channelled US$44 billion in loans from SCB over a decade to finance her projects through shell companies under the banner of real estate giant Van Thinh Phat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Between 2012 and 2020, SCB’s auditors – Ernst & Young Vietnam, Deloitte Vietnam, and KPMG Vietnam – failed to raise any red flags on the transactions. When the fraud was exposed at the time of Lan’s arrest, investigators said SCB incurred US$18 billion in accumulated losses following separate audits that were carried out.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/04/12/clean-thumb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:09</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Vietnamese property tycoon sentenced to death for US$12.5 billion fraud</p><p>Vietnamese property tycoon sentenced to death for US$12.5 billion fraud</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The three firms among the big four firms audited SCB and committed violations,” Vietnam Finance Minister Ho Duc Phoc said at a legislature hearing on 18 March. The court has ordered prosecutors and police to investigate the accounting giants over their certifications of SCB’s books.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lan has repaid part of the loans but a total of US$27 billion including interest is classified as non-recoverable. She asked her husband Chu Nap Kee in 2017 to use the Saigon Times Square building as loan collateral, according to prosecutors. Chu was sentenced to nine years in jail for breaking banking rules.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a bid to stabilise Vietnam’s financial system, the central bank earlier this month intervened to bail out SCB. The State Bank of Vietnam provided US$24 billion of special loans to SCB to prevent its collapse, according to a Reuters report. The amount was equivalent to one-quarter of the country’s foreign exchange reserves.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The injection of funds to ensure the rights of depositors at SCB is still ongoing,” said Le Dat Chi, Head of the Finance Department, University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This puts significant pressure on the central bank to implement other measures to attract this money back [into the system] to avoid pressures on the Vietnamese dong’s exchange rate,” Chi said. Until the “bad money” is removed from the system, it would exert significant pressure on the dong, he added.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">As Vietnam’s Russian arms supplies dry up, who will it turn to for weapons?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Vietnam, many lenders have overlapping shareholding and ownership structures, which make them vulnerable to influence by management, financial experts say. The sheer scale of the mismanagement and corruption in Lan’s case due to these structures was “simply too big to ignore”, Giang said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In November, a top Vietnamese official spoke on Lan’s case at a legislature hearing and urged banks to pay close attention to their shareholding structures and impose greater control on their operations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The state cannot guarantee the safety of the banking system,” said Pham Van Hoa, a delegate of Vietnam’s lawmaking body.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Lien, however, SCB’s management restructuring was not of paramount concern to her.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She said: “I don’t care who Lan is. Even if SCB changes its owner, the bank holds the responsibility to return my savings.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZLKku82opKKbo2Sus8DInKOeZ2Nng3GBkW5mraCfqsCiusOsZK%2Bhlam7ornErJxmpJGisq%2FAjKWgn51dqK63tc2gqmakn6jBbrrAraCopqNiuaK%2Bxp6qrWWWnruiusKimKVlo5iurg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./517796-what-pat-robertsons-net-worth-time-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What was Pat Robertson's net worth at the time of his death?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./314603-prayer-st-joseph-employment-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Prayer to St. Joseph for employment</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
