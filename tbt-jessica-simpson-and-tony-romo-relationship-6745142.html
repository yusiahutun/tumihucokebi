According to Jessica, she was watching a football game at home with her family in November 2007 when the former NFL star told reporters that she was his dream celebrity crush.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“My family was like, 'Did you just hear that?" Simpson <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>said</a> in the June 2008 issue of Glamour. "His picture came up, and I'm like, 'He's really cute.' Then I heard [that I was his crush], and I'm like, 'Oh my gosh!'”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They met after a mutual friend introduced Tony to Jessica’s dad, Joe Simpson, and soon the pair went on their first date. "I had butterflies that you would not imagine,” she recalled to Glamour. “I wanted to puke in the cup holder … It took me forever to put together an outfit!"&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image theme-1 mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once at dinner, the nerves settled, and they got cozy with each other — fast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The fact that this guy, on our first date, in the first 10 minutes of dinner, wanted to lean over the table and say, ‘This is my girl, and I want to kiss her' – our first kiss in front of everybody – was awesome,” Jessica remembered. Days later, they spent Thanksgiving together in Texas, and before everyone knew it, Jessica was cheering on Tony from the stands in her iconic pink Cowboys jersey.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them: </strong>They didn’t let the haters get them down. Just months into their relationship, Cowboy fans nicknamed Jessica “Yoko Romo,” blaming her for Tony’s poor performance and the team’s 2008 losing streak. Addressing the “jinxing” drama on The Late Show with David Letterman, Simpson vowed never to wear her infamous pink #9&nbsp; jersey again.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I really think it’s because I was wearing a pink No. 9 jersey and not a blue one,” Jessica said, adding that since she switched colors, the Cowboys have been “doing great.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While not everyone was a Simpson-Romo stan at the time, the couple told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vanity Fair</a> that they tend to tune out the drama.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image theme-1 mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We don't let it affect our relationship," she said. "If we did, we wouldn't be together, because it happened at the very beginning. Dating the Cowboys quarterback comes with hype, the fans, the bloggers, but I've never dated a guy that was more simple. I'm always there for him after a game, and he knows he has me to come home to."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Romo also gave his opinion on the controversy. “She comes to a ton of games,” Romo said. “She’s a supportive girlfriend. You know, it’s very hard when you lose because games are important, and so many people put so much time and effort in. It’s nice to have someone to come home to and try to make you feel better.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked: </strong>When Jessica dedicated the song, “You’re My Sunday,” to Tony during a concert for her country album tour. With lyrics like, “When life is like a hurricane / Flying off the rails like a fast train / Everything around me is so insane / You come and take it all away / You're my Sunday” — it’s cheesy, but nonetheless, sweet.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“My boyfriend is a football player, and he takes up my Sundays and now my Mondays,” Simpson said before introducing the song to the audience at the time, adding: “I am so happy!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup: </strong>A year and a half into their relationship, Tony <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>broke up with Jessica the day before her 29th birthday</a> on July 10, 2009. Her Ken and Barbie-themed party was canceled, and Jessica celebrated quietly with friends and family, while Tony was spotted out in Los Angeles at MyHouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“She is heartbroken,” a source told People. “She loves Tony. But it’s been difficult lately. He’s busy with his career, and she’s getting ready to shoot her show (The Price of Beauty). They decided to part ways.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eleven years later, Jessica finally spoke out about their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>“ugly” split</a> in her memoir Open Book. “[Tony] accused me of seeing John [Mayer] behind his back,” Simpson wrote. “I hadn’t cheated on Tony at all. But I could not lie and say I hadn’t even seen [Mayer]." Simpson saw Mayer at her parents' house, and Romo found out through an email the singer sent her about the run-in. Insisting "nothing happened," Romo "didn't believe that for a second" and broke up with Simpson on the spot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added that the “breakup had been so ugly that it shocked me into realizing it had been necessary.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image theme-1 mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now: </strong>The next summer, Jessica began dating her current husband, retired NFL tight end, Eric Johnson. In 2012, they welcomed their first child together, a daughter, Maxwell Drew, and a year later, a son named Ace Knute. The couple also shares a three-year-old daughter, Birdie Mae.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since 2009, Jessica’s singing career has taken a backseat, and the multi-hyphenate has focused most of her attention on her billion-dollar fashion brand. In October 2021, she and her mom, Tina Simpson, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>regained full ownership</a> of the company after selling their majority stake to Sequential Brands Group Inc. in 2015.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After splitting from Jessica, Tony began seeing 2008 Miss Missouri USA-winner Candice Crawford (she's also the sister to Gossip Girl alum Chace Crawford). The two got married in 2011 and they share three sons — Jones, 5, Rivers, 8, and Hawkins, 10.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Romo retired from football in 2017 following a preseason back injury the previous year. Upon his retirement, he was hired by CBS Sports as a lead NFL commentator.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">#TBT: Check in every Thursday as we throw it back to some of our favorite celebrity couples of all time.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5705urZqKVqMCqr8BmqqKloKi8r3nAp5tmrJ%2Bjxm6%2BzqamZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGKDeICUamtr</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./246330-the-moments-nicholas-biwott-total-man-died-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The very last moments of Nicholas Biwott, the Total Man, before he died</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./former-ambrosia-keyboardist-david-lewis-dies.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Former Ambrosia Keyboardist David Lewis Dies</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
