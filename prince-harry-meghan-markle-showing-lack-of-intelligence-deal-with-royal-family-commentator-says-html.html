According to a royal commentator, this could be a sign of a 'lack of intelligence' on the Sussexes' part.</p><p>Published on April 21, 2022</p><span></span><span>2 min read</span><p id=par-1_53>In 2020, <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> and <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> decided to <a href=#>step down as senior royals</a>. Since then, their relationship with the rest of the royal family has not been smooth-sailing. In fact, according to a royal commentator, the Sussexes’ way of dealing with the royals could be a sign of a “lack of intelligence.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Meghan-Markle-Prince-Harry-2.jpg><h2 id=h-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-have-made-headlines-since-stepping-down-as-senior-royals>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have made headlines since stepping down as senior royals</h2><p id=par-2_31>Although Harry and Meghan are living a more private life in California, the couple has not escaped scandals. Even after stepping down, they continued to do things that stir up headlines.</p><p id=par-3_53>For example, in March 2021, the pair had <a href=#>an interview with Oprah Winfrey</a>, where they criticized the royal family. In the next few months, Harry also had other interviews in which he claimed <a href=#>to have “genetic pain”</a> from Prince Charles’ parenting skills and that he was miserable during his time as a royal.</p><p id=par-4_29>Recently, at the Invictus Games, Harry also had an interview with Hoda Kotb. Here, he talked positively about Queen Elizabeth but <a href=#>dodged a question about his father and brother</a>.</p><p id=par-5_28>Additionally, Harry announced in 2021 that he would be releasing a memoir in late 2022. Rumor has it that the book will include more criticism of various royals.</p><h2>The Sussexes might be showing a ‘lack of intelligence,’ commentator says</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_20>Royal expert Jonathan Sacerdoti recently weighed in on Harry and Meghan’s behaviors ever since their departure from the royal family.</p><p id=par-7_41>“Meghan and Harry are constantly doing damage to the Royal Family,” Sacerdoti said (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Express</a>). “It seems intentional, if it’s not intentional, it’s then a reflection on their recklessness and perhaps lack of intelligence in how they deal with these things.”</p><p id=par-8_24>He added that this is likely hurting William, who used to be close with Harry but might now need to be on his guard.</p><p id=par-9_99>“If there is a meeting lined up it’s going to not be leaked to the press,” Sacerdoti explained. “What’s said needs to be thought about very carefully in case it is leaked and I think that applies for Prince William very much. It must hurt a lot for a brother who was once very close to Prince Harry. I think it must be difficult on a personal level to feel that you want to make some sort of peace, yet you’re worried about how you can do it, whether every overturn you make will be reported, twisted or leaked.”</p><h2>Prince Harry reportedly wants a mediator to help resolve his feud with Prince William</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_22>According to author Katie Nicholl, Harry is open to working out his feud with some members of the royal family, especially William.</p><p id=par-11_53>“Harry,&nbsp;I’m told, suggested perhaps that they might get some sort of a mediator in on sort of these talks,&nbsp;to make some progress,” Nicholl told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ET</a>. “It was something that he had suggested to his father. He’s made it very clear that he wants to sort things out. He wants things to be improved.”</p><p id=par-12_29>Nicholl also added about Harry’s relationship with William, “We have been told for many months now that they’re not close at the moment. It has been very, very difficult.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9s7XNnJxmoJGnv7p5zJ6eoZmeYrqivsqlnGarmKTEqrrGZqOam5tivKd5yKernqScnrSmusKeZJ2dkaF6uLXToWSrp6mWuW6ywKagpbFdmLyuucSnq5qsn6d6tK3YrGWhrJ2hfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./miley-cyrus-realized-marriage-liam-hemsworth-no-longer-working-7966550.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>This Is the Moment Miley Cyrus Realized Her Marriage to Liam Hemsworth Was No Longer Going to Wor</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jan-jekielek.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Jan Jekielek net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
