Many of his fans have been asking the question since the talented Mexican singer teased a music video collaboration with gorgeous influencer Dania Mendez.&nbsp;</p><p>The teaser came in the form of a video shared on TikTok. It captured Peso Pluma on a beach in the Dominican Republic, where he was said to be working on his upcoming music video. Of course, the teaser did not give too much away.</p><p>However, it did feature the appearance of TV personality and influencer Dania Mendez, who was on the beach with Pluma.&nbsp;Mendez, famous for her fabulous looks and astounding camera presence, also shared the video on her page and captioned it “Bye” – the title of the last track of his latest album.&nbsp;</p><p>Could this be proof they are together? Or could it be a promotional content? Keep reading to find out more.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/oluma-581x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Dania_Mendez_Peso_Plumas_Girlfriend></span>Is Dania Mendez Peso Pluma’s Girlfriend?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Many of their fans have been shipping the two together thanks to their music video collaboration. However, as things stand, there is no proof that the pair are dating or have been together.&nbsp;</p><p>When the teaser for the then-unreleased music video was posted, many suspected Mendez would feature in the video whether the pair were dating or not. They were right because in the full video, Mendez did play Pluma’s love interest, and they even kissed.&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, this confirmed nothing. However, the pair continued to be seen together.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mendez.jpg><p>While neither Pluma nor Mendez commented on rumors of them dating, they have not exactly done anything to dissuade people from jumping to conclusions.&nbsp;In May 2023, the fabulous pair were pictured holding hands at an airport after they flew in from the Dominican Republic. This further fueled the dating speculations; their fans had much to say about it.&nbsp;</p><p>Some took to Twitter to discuss the topic, obviously distraught that their favorite was off the market.&nbsp;One lamented, “Peso Pluma has a girlfriend, and it’s not me??? BRB, I’m gonna go kms,” while another opened up about dreaming that he asked her to be his girlfriend.&nbsp;</p><p>Another pleaded, “Please, God, make me the Peso Pluma’s girlfriend.”&nbsp;</p><p>Rumors that the Mexican artist is indeed dating Mendez remain unconfirmed. However, there have been no attempts to clear the rumors, so the possibility can’t be completely ruled out.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Did Peso Pluma Say About the Extra Attention He’s Been Getting?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>May 2023 was a big month for Peso Pluma. Aside from the dating rumors that started flying around about him, he became the first regional Mexican artist to get featured on “The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.”</p><p>These are factors that point to two things: his growing fame and career. Naturally, public pressure and scrutiny come with great fame, but Pluma seems prepared for it.&nbsp;</p><p>He is determined not to get dragged into scandals or feuds with more experienced artists. He <a href=#>said</a>: “I definitely feel a lot of eyes on me, but what’s important is to stay focused. I have no interest in gossip or clout.”&nbsp;</p><p>Many voices scream his name, but Pluma has said he only plans to speak through his music.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Peso_Pluma_Dating_Becky_G></span>Is Peso Pluma Dating Becky G?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Becky G is a Californian artist well-known in the entertainment industry for her versatility. She has worked as an actor, singer, rapper, songwriter, and model.&nbsp;</p><p>She and Peso Pluma sparked dating rumors because of how frequently they were seen together out in public. While their fans have suspected something is between them, neither party has addressed the topic.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Peso_Pluma></span>Who Is Peso Pluma?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Peso Pluma’s real name is Hassan Emilio Kabande Laija. He is a talented Mexican singer, rapper, and songwriter born on June 15, 1999.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pluma.jpg><p>He has been a music fan since he was young and credited his early years for greatly influencing his love of music. Pluma grew up in Mexico and has always had a strong passion for traditional Mexican music.</p><p>His country’s rich musical tradition inspired him, and he started developing his musical talents by learning to play the guitar in adolescence. Since then, Pluma has been improving his technique and experimenting.&nbsp;</p><p>His recent success is a by-product of his efforts, but he still has a long way to go before he is classified among stars like <a href=#>Bad Bunny</a> and Ozuna.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kvaa%2Fzmanpa2dlsBus8iro5%2BqmZq7pXnIrGShnV2ZrrW1zaBknZmenq5uucSnm56yXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-hotels-in-vegas-for-bachelorette-party.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>6 Best, Underrated Hotels in Las Vegas for Bachelorette Parties 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./parkway-drive-drummer-ben-gordon-lists-byron-bay-home-10m-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Parkway Drive drummer Ben Gordon lists his Byron Bay home for $10m</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
