They come from the same part of your heart.”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Outside of his career as a prolific rapper and producer—during which he’s collaborated with everyone from Beyoncé and Jay-Z to DMX and Kendrick Lamar—Dean is a passionate artist, having painted for over 25 years. “I paint in my free time as therapy,” he says, adding that large-scale abstract works are his style of choice and that he enjoys gifting his works to family and friends. “Everybody should grab a paintbrush and a canvas, even if you don’t have a trained skill,” he continues. “Paint what comes from your heart, your mind, what you’re feeling; it's a great exercise.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“Paint what comes from your heart, your mind, what you’re feeling; it’s a great exercise.”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Alongside his wife, Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Alicia Keys, Dean has also amassed an expansive personal collection of art, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/thedeancollection/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the Dean Collection" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the Dean Collection</a>, which includes works by Nina Chanel Abney, Jordan Casteel, Arthur Jafa, Deana Lawson, Kaws, and Kehinde Wiley, among many others. Opening February 10 at the Brooklyn Museum (whose board of trustees Dean has served on since 2015), <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/giants data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“Giants: Art From the Dean Collection of Swizz Beatz and Alicia Keys”" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">“Giants: Art From the Dean Collection of Swizz Beatz and Alicia Keys”</a> will mark the first public exhibition devoted to the collection. While the museum show will focus on works by Black diasporic artists, Dean emphasizes that the collection as a whole comprises pieces by artists of all different disciplines and backgrounds. “We have artists from around the world—we’re not Black collectors, we’re just collectors,” he explains. “But we realized that there were artists of color that weren’t being collected by collectors of color because they weren’t being promoted to us. We wanted to change that. With the Dean Collection, we want to encourage our culture to collect the culture.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dean and Keys are also co-chairs of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.gordonparksfoundation.org/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gordon Parks Foundation" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Gordon Parks Foundation</a>, which preserves and showcases the work of the groundbreaking Black photographer, filmmaker, musician, and activist. (The husband and wife also happen to be the largest private collectors of Parks’s work.) And through his traveling art fair No Commission, which gives participating artists 100 percent of their sales proceeds and is free for anyone to enter, Dean is striving to make the art world more accessible and equitable. “It’s all about creating entry points,” he says.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“We want to encourage our culture to collect the culture.”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For our Art issue, Dean curated a playlist of songs he hopes will “put people into an artistic mood.” Along with multi-instrumentalist and singer St. Panther’s “These Days” and Cleo Sol’s “When I’m in Your Arms,” he included Texas trio Khruangbin’s “Summer Madness.” “That song is the ultimate cleanse,” Dean says of the last. “It’s like taking your shoes off at the front door and getting comfortable.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Listen to Swizz Beatz’s playlist exclusively on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://apple.co/sbhbplaylist data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Apple Music" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Apple Music</a>.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/6a1058ec-b4e1-42bb-8b16-65376e43cfd3_1707141888.png alt="Headshot of Ariana Marsh" title="Headshot of Ariana Marsh" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Ariana Marsh is Harper Bazaar’s senior features editor.
