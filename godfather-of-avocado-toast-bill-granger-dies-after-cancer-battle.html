So Cruel. Deepest love to N, E, I and B.”</p><p>Jamie Oliver also said he was “devastated” by the news.</p><p>He wrote: “This is devastating news, I’m so sad to hear this, what a guy he was …. a wonderful human, kind calm soul.</p><p>“I admired everything he represented in food.

These included Sydney, London, Osaka, Greater Tokyo, Fukuoka and Seoul.</p><p>The chef also wrote 14 cookbooks, made five <a href=#>TV</a> shows and was handed the Medal of the Order of Australia in January of this year.</p><p>Bill was named as the ‘King of Breakfast’ and ‘Godfather of avocado toast’. He was known for making unpretentious food into something much more.</p><p>MasterChef Australia host Matt Preston also paid tribute.</p><p>He said: “Bill was a genuinely lovely bloke and an inspiration. Together, he (with Natalie by his side) helped shape the image of modern Australian food around the world.”</p><p>“My thoughts are with his family, friends and all those he worked with at this sad time.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2eEcLPOnZ2arJiav267xWaYr6eTlrGwedOomKysXZe2rbiMoKmappeav26wyJ6qZpmWqbKzecKapZydomKvosDTpZxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./handsome-guy-bandit-jailed-35-years-pleading-guilty-bank-robbery-spree-left-61-victims-wake-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Handsome Guy Bandit' jailed for 35 years after pleading guilty to bank robbery spree that left 61 v</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nine-year-old-handcuffed-at-school-parents-sue.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Video Released of 9-Year-Old Handcuffed At School, Screaming &amp;amp; Crying for 13 Minutes; Parents Sue</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
