Bush</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Laura Bush</strong></a>, out to dinner on November 5 for a special occasion.</p><p>“Happiest birthday to our darling mama!” Jenna, 41, captioned a carousel of photos with her loved ones on Instagram. “We’re so happy to get to spend the night with you, just the four of us! We love you so! @laurawbush AND happiest 46 years to our parents. Love you both!”</p><p>The former president and former first lady looked elated to be spending the night with their girls, both of whom have built impressive careers for themselves. The day prior, Laura rang in her 77th birthday at an event promoting Jenna and Barbara’s new book, Love Comes First, which is due out on Tuesday, November 7.</p><p>“My birthday was made all the more special by a visit from our girls!” Laura reflected in a post on her Instagram page. “Be sure to check out their darling new book, Love Comes First. In the book, two little girls wish on a star for their family to grow, which is what my own wish was as a child.”</p><p>The Today host and the activist are currently in the middle of a 12-stop book tour, which kicked off on November 2. Along the way, they made a pit stop in Waco, Texas, for dinner at Bertie’s on the Rooftop with <a href=#><strong>Chip</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Joanna Gaines</strong> </a>at their <a href=#>newly opened Hotel 1928</a>.</p><p>“Loved eating at Bertie’s on the Rooftop at @thehotel1928 last night with these cuties,” Joanna, 45, captioned a photo with <a href=#>the Bush twins</a> on her Instagram Stories on November 4.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jenna-Bush-Hager-and-Twin-Sister-Barbara-Reunite-With-Parents.jpg><p>Love Comes First marks Jenna and Barbara’s fourth book collaboration over the past few years. The broadcaster and the Global Health Corps cofounder released their first project, Sisters First: Stories From Our Wild and Wonderful Life, in 2017. They released two children’s books in the years that followed: 2019’s Sisters First and 2022’s The Superpower Sisterhood.</p><p>“The inspiration for our new children’s book, Love Comes First, is really about how our heart has so much room to grow,” Jenna shared in an interview with <a href=#>Little, Brown Books for Young Readers</a> on August 18.</p><p>For the siblings, working together has only made their bond stronger over the years, especially after they both <a href=#>experienced motherhood</a>. Jenna is a mom to kids <a href=#>Mila</a>, <a href=#>Poppy</a> and <a href=#>Hal</a> with husband <a href=#><strong>Henry Hager</strong> </a>and Barbara shares <a href=#>daughter Cora</a> with husband <a href=#><strong>Craig Coyne</strong></a>.</p><p>“Our first books that we wrote together were about sisterhood — the fact that we were born a twin and had a partner in our life forever — and then we expanded, talking about sisterhood being chosen family and a chosen friends that become family,” Barbara explained. “And after that, when both of our families grew, we wanted to keep writing about how there’s always room for more love.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46jnKemkWKvtr%2FHZp%2Ban5WneqK6w2arsKGeYsCqv9OeqWaakaevor7AZqmerZ6ewaZ51qKroWWglr%2BmutOsZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./homeless-murders-las-vegas-police-arrest-mannequin-plot.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mannequin sting catches suspect in Las Vegas homeless murders | Las Vegas</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kaelen-haworth-shares-advice-from-norma-kamali.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Designer Kaelen Haworth on What She's Learned From Norma Kamali</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
