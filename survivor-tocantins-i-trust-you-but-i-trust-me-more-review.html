I'm a sucker for happy endings. After watching <a href=# class="link jsx-1337145738 jsx-3925284146 underlined" rel="noopener noreferrer">Survivor</a> since the very beginning of the series, and seeing countless people that should have won go to the end and get voted off because they were seen as a threat, I'm happy to see not only Bob last year, but <a href=# class="link jsx-1337145738 jsx-3925284146 underlined" rel="noopener noreferrer">JT</a> this year get the million and the $100,000 player of the season award. Call me a bit Coach-like (seriously, do it, that guy kicks an insurmountable amount of ass) but I like seeing the warriors battle it out, and I want to see the best of the best win.<br>The finale this year, as well as the reunion show, is some of the best straight competition and entertainment (respectively) I've seen from the series. Props have got to go to JT for winning so many immunity challenges – yeah, three in a row at the end there – and for playing such a social game. At the same time, we got an amazing Jalapao win for having JT, <a href=# class="link jsx-1337145738 jsx-3925284146 underlined" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen</a>, and <a href=# class="link jsx-1337145738 jsx-3925284146 underlined" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taj</a> go so far with only having the three of them at the merge, and in the end I think the two guys got out of everything still being friends, which is pretty impressive in a game that's all about causing strain, suffering, social breakdown, and sabotage on the players themselves.<p>There were some seriously debatable moves made in the final two hours of this show, such as not only voting off Taj right away (I personally dig the move, but it was a bit of a heartbreaker as well) and then having JT keep Stephen with him, but it was also some pretty good TV. The challenges themselves were great, though the ball one didn't exactly go a long time, and it was obvious that it was made just to give Stephen and <a href=# class="link jsx-1337145738 jsx-3925284146 underlined" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erinn</a> a run at JT's physical ability, but in the end the guy kicked a whole lot of ass and proved exactly why he was the golden boy from day one on this show.</p><p>I thought the jury interviews were good this year, but they were far from as heated or drama-filled as they have been in the last few years. I thought pinning the whole "Would you take JT with you" thing on Stephen was pretty lame, since it never happened, so he didn't have a chance to actually and truly know which way he would have been voting (that, and the jury wanted to hear him say "No, I would have voted him off and kept Erinn," so in order to stand a chance I think he was slanted towards that answer) but it was still a pretty great ending to see two guys that aligned themselves together basically from day one, and then go on to go head to head in the finale.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvmedia.ign.com/tv/image/article/983/983870/97597_D23687_1242648915.jpg> Seriously though. If I was on that jury I would have asked Stephen what, if anything, he spearheaded as a strategic move. I think everyone saw JT as the main power, and just like nobody wanted to vote him out ever, nobody wanted to hear what Stephen was really doing behind the scenes in his partnership. Odd, but whatever , it's done now, and I feel that the best guy won.</p><p>The finale was also something truly worth watching if you were a fan and didn't check it out yet, so go online and watch it if you missed it for some reason. <a href=# class="link jsx-1337145738 jsx-3925284146 underlined" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff</a> attempts to get <a href=# class="link jsx-1337145738 jsx-3925284146 underlined" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coach</a> to take a lie detector test, only to have himself blindsided (and yeah, it's obvious that Coach needs to come back for an All-Stars season… they need to make it happen) and it was pretty cool to see everyone back. Really though, you got all the basics we've already seen before, with <a href=# class="link jsx-1337145738 jsx-3925284146 underlined" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyson</a> saying "I'm awesome," <a href=# class="link jsx-1337145738 jsx-3925284146 underlined" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sierra</a> almost crying, and all the same business over and over. Still, it was good fun. A great cast, but not too many All-Star players outside of Coach and maybe Tyson, and JT. Warrior alliance for the win!</p><p>And really, what else can be said. Either you dig that JT won, you're pissed that the easy choice was made, you're addicted to the show and already watched it, or you couldn't care less. I personally wish I could go back and watch the whole season over again though -- I'd buy this set on DVD I think -- since JT and Stephen had the whole thing on lock for so long, and knowing the end now makes their domination all the sweeter.</p><p>Great ending to the show, and great ending to this season. The challenges rocked, the filming for the show is top notch (amazing b-roll) and Jeff Probst is the freaking man.</p><p>Another great season.
