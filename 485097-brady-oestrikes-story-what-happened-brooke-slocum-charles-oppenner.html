His killings of Charles Oppenneer and a pregnant Brooke Slocum (and how he did it) shocked many people. To some people, especially his <a href=#>family</a> and friends, he was a normal person “who got into something he was not supposed to.” Here are some interesting facts about him:</p><h3>1. He is a native of Michigan</h3><p class=align-left>Brady Oestrike was born on<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> December 4, 1982</a>, in Michigan, United States. He was the only child of Richard and Kristine Oestrike. However, he had three step-siblings (Anne Oestrike, Barbara Miling, and Wendy Oestrike).</p><p class=align-left>Oestrike had a normal childhood, growing up alongside his siblings in their blended family. He was homeschooled by his mother, in between stints at various<a href=#> private schools</a>. Afterwards, he went to a technical school, where he trained as an electrician.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/78f96e89fae70d91.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Jared Toller? All to know about Constance Nunes' husband</span></p></a><h3>2. Brady worked as an electrician</h3><p class=align-left>Oestrike worked as a power line technician for an<a href=#> energy company</a> (presumably in Michigan). After undergoing technical training, he rose to the position of supervisor, which earned him enough money to afford a house in his 20s. Unfortunately, the house would become the scene of his heinous murders a few years later.</p><p class=align-left>Besides his work, Oestrike was also into several hobbies. He loved LARP (live-acting role-playing) games such as Dungeons and Dragons. He also liked to collect medieval swords and weapons such as guns and knives.</p><h3>3. He was a Christian</h3><p class=align-left>Brady Oestrike was a religious person who observed the<a href=#> Christian faith</a>. He was very involved in his local church and participated in church missions to countries such as Haiti and Ukraine. He even attended a Bible school - the Montana Wilderness School of the Bible.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/36df72ff90c2c4bc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Jose Altuve's wife? What to know about Nina Altuve</span></p></a><h3>4. Brady Oestrike was once engaged to be married</h3><p class=align-left>The Michigan Craigslist killer was once engaged to be married. He was in a long-term relationship with a Canadian woman and was<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> once engaged </a>to her. However, the relationship fell apart in 2013, about a year before he committed his heinous crimes. According to his family, the woman took advantage of him.</p><p class=align-left>It was alleged that she always asked him for money to come and visit him. It is also claimed that she left him about a month before their wedding and she refused to return a $30,000 engagement ring he had bought her. However, Oestrike’s ex-fiancée claimed that they had mutually decided to split up, as their relationship was not working anymore.</p><h3>5. He was suspected of killing a pregnant woman and her boyfriend</h3><p class=align-left>In 2014, Brady Oestrike was suspected of killing Brooke Slocum, an 18-year-old Michigan resident, and her boyfriend, Charles Oppenneer. Brooke was eight months pregnant, making Brady a triple murder suspect.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/26246ef0b9a3dcd9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Trevor Ombija's bio: background, family, education, and career</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It started on Craigslist when Brooke posted an ad asking someone to lend her $50 to buy medicine. Oestrike responded and offered her $120 for a sexual encounter with her boyfriend. Brooke Slocum and Charles Oppenneer agreed to meet with Brady in a wooded park in Michigan for the encounter, unaware they were being lured to their deaths.</p><p class=align-left>In July 2014, police officers found Oppenneer’s headless body in the park where the trio were supposed to meet. Their investigation led them to the Craigslist ad, which led them to Brady Oestrike. Oestrike was suspected of decapitating Oppenneer and hid his body under<a href=#> tree branches</a>. Investigations later revealed that he had abducted Brooke Slocum and tortured her for several days before strangling her.</p><h3>6. He committed sui*cide after escaping from the police</h3><p class=align-left>When police linked Brady Oestrike to the death of Charles Oppenneer and the disappearance of his pregnant girlfriend, they obtained a warrant to raid his home. However, he fled his residence before the raid started, starting a police chase, which ended when he crashed his vehicle.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2e48a8d45521b061.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Missy Murray? What to know about Kyler Murray's mom</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Before Oestrike could be apprehended, he committed sui*cide by shooting himself in the head. In his crashed car, the police found the body of Brooke Slocum, whom they suspect had been killed on the same day. Unfortunately, her unborn child did not survive the encounter.</p><p class=align-left>Since he committed sui*cide before he was apprehended, Oestrike was never charged nor convicted for the murders of Brooke Slocum, her unborn child, and her boyfriend. However, police obtained enough evidence to positively identify him as the suspect behind the heinous crimes.</p><h3>7. Oestrike had a se*x room in his house</h3><p class=align-left>After Oestrike committed sui*cide, police raided his house and discovered several things. One discovery was a room referred to by the police and some media as a “se*x room” inside his house. The room was in his basement (leading some people to call it a se*x dungeon), where he kept and tortured Brooke Slocum for several days before killing her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/02a5b8fb30ef366f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Ale Gicqueau? Teal Swan relationship and life story</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Police also recovered a home surveillance video in Brady Oestrike’s house. Some videos, which have since been released to the public, showed him “preparing the se*x room” days before he killed Oppenneer and abducted Brooke Slocum. In the videos, he is seen preparing a dog cage, where - according to police – he kept Slocum after abducting her.</p><p class=align-left>He is also seen walking around with a chain, padlock, and hanging ropes from the basement ceiling. Police recovered several bondage items (such as whips) and se*x toys in the Michigan Craigslist killer’s basement. They also recovered a cache of several weapons, including assault rifles. Also recovered were some of Brady Oestrike’s writing, which revealed some dark obsessions, including inflicting pain.</p><h3>8. Brady Oestrike was likely suffering from mental health illness</h3><p class=align-left>Oestrike’s family and a friend have claimed that he seemed normal and that they did not detect any warning signs. However, a few people who had closer interactions with him have said otherwise. One of these people is his former roommate <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Rachael Morris</a>. According to Morris, Oestrike once told her that he had “bad dreams” and “was having thoughts about killing her.”</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/26686ea7b03f1b09.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Marshall Trenkmann: Karla Souza (HTGAWM) relationship and family</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Oestrike was also reportedly paranoid and had several weapons in his house. He was also a gun nut and had accidentally fired a gun several times in his home, including once when there was a Bible session study with kids in the house. The police officer who investigated his crimes also revealed an insight into his mind.</p><p class=align-left>Brady Oestrike was a sadistic killer with dark obsessions, which finally manifested through his gruesome crimes. Unfortunately, no one will truly ever know what was in his mind, as he committed sui*cide before being apprehended and held accountable for his actions.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke published an article about <a href=#>Carl Judie</a>. Carl Judie died on 14 February 2021, and many people felt they had lost somebody that inspired them for many years. He was not an A-list actor like many Hollywood actors but was an internet sensation who used YouTube to educate the masses on the things surrounding them. As a result, he became a <a href=#>celebrity</a> in his own right.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/45ec4284982f34af.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet Polo G's mom, Stacia Mac, who is also the rapper's manager</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He was an American actor and entrepreneur. He was well known for his work on Dhar Mann’s YouTube channel, a series of short motivational viral videos in which he appeared in more than 50 clips.
