Spanning 330 concerts across the world, it’s hard to imagine life without new music from the icon from here on out.</p><p>The Rocket Man singer has a stunning property portfolio, it’s pretty clear he has a love of <a href=#>real estate</a>.</p><p>From Beverly Hills to Windsor near the <a href=#>royals</a>, he isn’t shy about splashing out on luxury.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/014_2660_peachtree_road_36d-960x640-1.jpg><p>Elton is known for loving an extra lifestyle, never afraid to go all out on his outfits, accessories and wild antics on stage while performing. Inside his list of estates, he has two mansions based in Los Angeles that are next door to each other. It’s also where Elton and his husband David Furnish decided to isolate with their two sons during lockdown.</p><p>Not just that, but he also has a villa in Nice, France. He bought the 1920 property 30 years ago. It’s believed to be worth more than $18 million, and the place-to-be for his celebrity-filled parties. He even invited <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and Prince Harry to use the abode when they enjoyed a holiday with Archie in 2019.</p><p>Where do we buy tickets?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-inside-elton-john-s-atlanta-condo>Inside Elton John’s Atlanta condo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/009_2660_peachtree_road_36d-960x640-1.jpg><p>LA isn’t the only place he’s set down roots in America, Elton John also has his Atlanta condo – until someone else snaps it up. In 1993, the singer bought this property as his first ever home in the US. It’s found on the 36th floor of a sky-high building, so if you’re terrified of heights, maybe skip this one. Now, we can see inside the estate thanks to <a href=# rel=nofollow>TopTenRealEstateDeals</a>.</p><p>Looking back at why he decided to buy the place, he told Architectural Digest that it was the people that swayed him.</p><p>“I like that Southern hospitality,” he said. “Everyone is incredibly courteous and friendly.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/089_2660_Peachtree_Road_36D-960x640-1.jpg><p>The star, who has sold more than 300 million records worldwide, is deciding to give it up to live in Windsor full-time. It’s been in his possession throughout his 50 number-one hits, seven smash-hit albums and making history on the Billboard charts.</p><p>The Candle In The Wind hitmaker paid $925,000 for the luxury high-rise apartment initially. Over time, he added five neighboring units to construct the masterpiece. It now sits at 13,300-square-foot, with four bedrooms, seven bathrooms and two floors.</p><p>He’s definitely seeking to get his money back with that impressive investment.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-full-skyline-views>Full skyline views</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/065_2660_Peachtree_Road_36D-960x640-1.jpg><p>One of the biggest selling points of the property is the 360 degrees views of the skyline. The stunning horizon is the focal point, with the floor to ceiling windows it’s hard to miss.</p><p>Rooms feature Greek-esque columns, intricate moldings, unique chandeliers and glass-wall staircases. And if you want some alone time, there are multiple balconies on all sides of the condo. No matter if the sun is rising or setting, you can see it at any time of day.</p><p>The primary master suite features its own onyx-clad bathroom, walk-in closet and private balcony.</p><p>The kitchen has a gorgeous breakfast bar, as well as stainless-steel appliances.</p><p>Thinking about parties? The suite has a two-story salon and dining room, as well as a living area. Don’t worry about condensing down your guest list, as you can easily fit all your friends and loved ones in this space for entertaining.</p><p>Dotted around the walls of Elton John’s Atlanta condo is his one-of-a-kind photography collection. A lover of art, you can see the multiple gallery areas have been specifically designed to show off the work.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-intricate-design>Intricate design</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/033_2660_peachtree_road_36d-960x640-1.jpg><p>The design is oozing luxury inside and out. From the ground, the high-rise building is surrounded by greenery and blue skies. It’s one of the tallest towers in the area, so no one will be casting a shadow over your view, for sure.</p><p>Elton John has decorated his Atlanta condo with sophisticated designs, to compliment the wide walls and ceilings.</p><p>The home office also features a not-to-be-missed view, offering inspiration during the most frustrating mind-blocks.</p><p>The main private bathroom, with glass chandeliers, has his and her sinks with wood furnishings. There’s also a couch if you need a break from getting glammed up each morning.</p><p>Then, the walk-in closet has ample room for you to look your best every single day.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-perfect-for-wine-lovers>Perfect for wine-lovers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/elton-john-10-960x640-1.jpg><p>If you can’t say no to a glass of vino, the condo also has five dedicated wine storage units for those special occasions. Besides that, there’s a home gym, spa and massage room and three guest suites for your stay over guests.</p><p>The meticulously designed home has ample seating areas, blonde-hardwood floors and lots of light from the gorgeous windows.</p><p>If you’re worried about space, he’s got that sorted. Elton’s home has nine reserved parking spaces – likely from the condos he used to create his own mega-condo – and six private storage units.</p><p>Situated in the ‘Beverly Hills of the South’, the condo is based in Atlanta’s Buckhead. The district is known for upscale malls, art galleries, mansions and fine dining. Only the best for Elton, apparently.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/045_2660_peachtree_road_36d-960x640-1.jpg><p>It’s the second-wealthiest zip code in the South. Only Palm Beach in Florida trumps this lavish area.</p><p>It’s also home to entrepreneurs, CEOs and famous faces of the entertainment world.</p><p>Other celebs who called the area their forever home include <a href=#>movie</a> stars Isla Fisher and funny man Sscha Braron Cohen. Also, Young Thug and Tyler Perry live in the neighborhood.</p><p>The listing is held by Chase Mizell of Atlanta Fine Homes Sotheby’s International Realty</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2eDcLXNrKCdnV2aubW7zWahqKCeqHp2uYycpqecn2LEqsDHZpmrnZGptbWtyqKloGWmnrK4v4yapZ1lmanAbsPOq6uhZZWrsrPFjJ2gpp1f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./house-dresses-summer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>11 House Dresses You'll Want to Live In This Summer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./format-a-disk-on-ubuntu.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to Format a Disk on Ubuntu (in 2 Ways)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
