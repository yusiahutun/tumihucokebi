In recent years, her costars have all spoken openly about their <a href=#>favorite moments from the serie</a>s. While McCarthy rarely discusses&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;with the press, she did take part in a Reddit AMA in 2015. During the online event, McCarthy revealed her favorite moment from her time on the show happened during her on-set downtime.</p><h2 id=h-melissa-mccarthy-s-sookie-st-james-isn-t-in-the-netflix-gilmore-girls-revival>Melissa McCarthy’s Sookie St. James isn’t in the Netflix ‘Gilmore Girls’ revival</h2><p id=par-2_39>McCarthy spent seven years on&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;playing&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">renowned chef Sookie St. James</a>. The accident-prone chef was the perfect best friend and business partner for Lorelai Gilmore. Fans and critics largely consider&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;McCarthy’s breakout role, and Sookie quickly became a fan favorite.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_63>McCarthy almost didn’t play the famed inn chef, though.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alex Borstein was initially cast</a> to portray Sookie in the pilot. When she couldn’t get out of her&nbsp;Mad TV&nbsp;contract, the team recast the role. Borstein still appeared in&nbsp;Gilmore Girls, though. She appeared in season one as Drella, the Independence Inn’s harpist. Later, she showed up at the Gilmore residence as Miss Celine, Emily Gilmore’s seamstress.</p><p id=par-4_73>When it came time for Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, <a href=#>Melissa McCarthy did not return</a> to the set. The actor revealed she initially wasn’t asked back for the revival because producers assumed she was too busy. That ended up being true as McCarthy’s scheduled didn’t align with production on A Year in the Life. However, there are no hard feels as the actor fondly looked back on her time as Sookie.</p><h2 id=h-a-baby-joke-got-her-in-trouble-but-was-melissa-mccarthy-pregnant-during-gilmore-girls>A baby joke got her in trouble, but was Melissa McCarthy pregnant during ‘Gilmore Girls’?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_44>McCarthy’s favorite moment from&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;might not be what you expected. The famed comedian said her favorite memory from the show came in her downtime on the set. That same moment also reportedly got her in trouble with not one but two different tour groups.</p><p id=par-6_94>In&nbsp;a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> AMA, McCarthy revealed that while filming as pregnant Sookie, she liked to smoke a cigarette and hit her prop stomach to make the prop team laugh. The bit, which she agrees was in poor taste, was all fun and games until a tour group that McCarthy didn’t know was coming through watched in horror. A few days later, McCarthy repeated the gag, only to be caught by a second tour group. The groups had no idea that McCarthy wasn’t pregnant in real life. She insists no amount of explaining made it better.</p><p id=par-7_51>McCarthy was not pregnant during two of her three on-screen pregnancies. The gag, according to McCarthy, happened during season 5, when Sookie was pregnant with Martha. In season 7,&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;writers wrote&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a strange pregnancy arc</a>&nbsp;into the final season to accommodate McCarthy’s first real-life pregnancy. Her daughter, Vivian Falcone, was born in 2007.</p><h2 id=h-melissa-mccarthy-worked-with-a-gilmore-girl-s-alum-for-netflix>Melissa McCarthy worked with a ‘Gilmore Girl’s alum for Netflix</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dragonfly-Inn.jpg><p id=par-8_52>McCarthy’s time on the set of&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;propelled her career forward. Much to the chagrin of fans, McCarthy didn’t appear in most of&nbsp;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. For fans who missed McCarthy’s signature interactions with other cast members, they have a chance to see it again, albeit in a different show.</p><p id=par-9_40>McCarthy and&nbsp;Yanic Truesdale, the <a href=#>actor who portrayed Michel Gerrard</a> on&nbsp;Gilmore Girls, collaborated on a Netflix original series.&nbsp;God’s Favorite Idiot&nbsp;is currently filming in Australia. The series, executive produced by McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone, hit Netflix in June 2022.</p><p id=par-10_34>There are no concrete plans for Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life Season 2. However, it sounds as if Melissa McCarthy would be open to returning if the Stars Hollow gang does reunite.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS0qrjMqKmeZZeev62%2FjJqlZqeeYsCmwIyjpqSdXZy8tXnMnqOiq6OWeq6vwpqpraCpYsGzu9Sbo55lYmLBsMHRZp6rp6WlwG%2B006ajaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./erin-andrews-welcomes-baby-no-1-with-husband-jarret-stoll.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Erin Andrews Welcomes Baby No. 1 With Husband Jarret Stoll</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./actress-deborah-kerr-was-a-private-person-daughter-says.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Actress Deborah Kerr Was a 'Private Person,' Daughter Says</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
