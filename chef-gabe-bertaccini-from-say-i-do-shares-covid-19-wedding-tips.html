And at times, it really, actually, kind of forces the bride and the groom to reconsider their big day and kind of move it into a more intimate, sometimes just family-and-really-close-friends gathering.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Chef-Gabe-Bertaccini-From-Netflix-Say-I-Do-Shares-How-Couples-Can-Honor-a-Lost-Wedding-Date-Due-to-COVID-19-01.jpg><p>The Italian chef added: “We’re going really back to what a wedding is, which is a showcase of love, commitment and union in front of the people that you really love and care about, which is fantastic.”</p><p>Still Bertaccini knows that it’s been tough for <a href=#>couples who have had to reschedule or alter the nuptials</a> because of the coronavirus pandemic, so he shared some tips on how to honor a lost wedding day and noted that he’s encouraged his own clients to take a different approach to their own festivities, which now have much smaller guest lists.</p><p>“I said, ‘Listen, there is no point in doing this whole crazy expensive day. Let’s hold on on that, and just do something that means a lot to you,’ which in this case was a beautiful backyard wedding, and we created this beautiful long table,” he explained, pointing out that the “fancy” menu still worked. “We had filet, we had lobster, we had caviar, we had oysters, we had sea urchins and so forth. It became something completely different. It became a family-style affair, [with a] beautiful long table.”</p><p>And since the large floral centerpieces you might find at a wedding at a more typical venue were out of the question, Bertaccini and his team got creative with their surroundings. “It was beautiful to incorporate what they had in the backyard. They actually are very lucky to have these amazing olive trees … and we really created this beautiful garland, going from one end to another, of olive branches and then some really stunning tall candles all night.”</p><p>Though the pandemic has pushed Bertaccini and his team to think outside of the box, he told Us that he’s actually a fan of using one’s surroundings to liven up a tablescape in any circumstances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Chef-Gabe-Bertaccini-From-Netflix-Say-I-Do-Shares-How-Couples-Can-Honor-a-Lost-Wedding-Date-Due-to-COVID-19-02.jpg><p>“My suggestion for anybody that is looking to spice up their dining table is to bring the space on the table. So, if you are in the backyard, then try and use whatever you have in the backyard and use it on the table. If you’re having it in a beautiful vegetable garden, create a beautiful centerpiece with the vegetables that you are actually using in the menu.”</p><p>As for why he got involved with Say I Do, in which one half of a deserving couple surprises the other half with a wedding thrown together in just a few days, Bertaccini told Us it was all about bringing joy to others. “For me, it wasn’t about doing something that showcases my trade. It was something where I could use what I do, and the passion and love I have for cooking, to give back,” he explained. “Being able to give back to these couples that have been through the wringer in their lives was something that truly, I’ll remember for the rest of my life.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Say I Do is available to stream on Netflix on July 1.</p><p>With reporting by Travis Cronin.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZpyglZt6qK3BnmSbnaKprqSvyKegZp6ipLpuv8CyZKJllKR6tLTAq5ysZZOkw6qwjGpwZq%2BVmbGqusZmq6Koo2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./qc-symphony-youth-conductor-to-leave.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>QC Symphony youth conductor to leave</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bre-tiesi-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Selling Sunset's Bri Tiesi's Net Worth Explored</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
