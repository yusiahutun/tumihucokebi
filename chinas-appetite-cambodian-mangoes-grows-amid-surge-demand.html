Growers seeking direct sales would need to navigate the challenge of leasing expensive containers to transport mangoes across different rivers to the key Cambodian port of Sihanoukville in the southwest, where the fruit would be transferred to ships bound for big cities on China’s coast.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Many river containers don’t have air-conditioning and you need electricity at the port to store the mangoes before they are delivered to the vessel.
