It’s all about the details, especially since the moon will be joining extravagant Jupiter in a lovely trine just a day after going direct in <a href=#>Venus-ruled </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taurus</a>. Bountiful, joyous, and visually up to par—the perfect recipe for a celebration as dazzling as New Year’s Eve. Charming Venus—which can also represent celebratory gatherings and memorable moments—will be transiting the first couple of degrees of Sagittarius, where spontaneity and adventure reign.</p><p>While the moon in Virgo has you perfecting your look or retaking your NYE selfie in hopes of capturing the perfect lighting, Venus in Sagittarius prefers the beauty in unfiltered moments that encourage authenticity. Anyone with social media knows fake candidness all too well, but Jupiter in Taurus wants the beautifully raw moments. Also, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mercury retrograde in the mix</a>, small delays and/or misunderstandings are inevitable, so free yourself from any and all expectations.

You’re passionate and impulsive, but there’s no use in stressing logistics and rushing through your NYE glam. Take a long bath, squeeze in a power nap, and get inspired with a Get Ready With Me vlog instead. You love to be first but not the first one to arrive at the party, right?

It’s hard to believe with Jupiter on your head, lush and larger-than-life itself, but it’s probably best to steer away from the post-cocktail commentary and petty gossip. Conversations leading up to the countdown could lead to fireworks, literally. On a brighter note, your OOTD is up to par, and with the moon livening up your fifth house of acknowledgment, celebration, and self-expression, it’s all eyes on you… and, for better or for worse.

After all, it’s not every day lucky Jupiter lights up your socialite 11th house of friendship and community, so consider this a NYE to cherish.

For some, the plan might include a relaxed evening on the couch with takeout, patiently awaiting the countdown in favorite pajamas. However, with the moon energizing your eighth house of intimacy, a part of you might still yearn for a closer connection, even if it’s just a New Year’s wish.
