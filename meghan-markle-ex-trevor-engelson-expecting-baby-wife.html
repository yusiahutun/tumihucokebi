Trevor reportedly popped the question at a vineyard in Napa Valley, taking to Instagram to share a loved-up photo of the couple. "Luckiest guy I know! Get ready to party!" he wrote on his private account. The couple were married in a lavish ceremony at the Rosewood Miramar Beach resort in Montecito in May last year.</p><p id=eaVTWTMXdtG data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince William and Kate Middleton's love story – from university sweethearts to proud parents</a></strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=eOjIrp6KN4of data-wc=12><strong>WATCH: Everything you need to know about Meghan Markle's mum Doria Ragland</strong></p><p id=eXrBk7ICY8Pm data-wc=124>He started a relationship with Meghan in 2004, and the pair were married on 10 September 2011 at the Jamaica Inn in Ocho Rios. The couple enjoyed a four-day celebration before Meghan and Trevor exchanged vows in a quick, 15-minute ceremony in front of 102 guests. They separated 18 months later, and were granted a divorce in August 2013 citing irreconcilable differences. Reports have claimed that Meghan's acting role in was a catalyst for their break-up. The TV star was required to spend long periods of time in Toronto, where Suits is filmed, while Trevor lived in LA. Meghan was still a newlywed when she landed her job on the legal drama, causing a long-distance battle at the start of their married life.</p><p id=eM3Q6vSLVZr2 data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>The Duchess of Cornwall proudly shows off picture of her five grandchildren</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ca9d239a4b7d-meghan-markle-trevor-engleson-1z-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eXS0UBS5UnUD data-wc=9><strong>Trevor and Meghan were married from 2011 until 2013</strong></p><p id=eoFa_PJI0OGd data-wc=83>Royal biographer Andrew Morton wrote in his book : "Whether she wanted to admit it to herself or not, Meghan, who once said she couldn't imagine life without Trevor by her side, was now building a new world for herself. As Toronto was becoming more her home than LA, the dynamics in their relationship subtly altered. She was her own woman now, earning a steady income, making new friends on set and off, no longer dependent on her husband's connections."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
