No wonder he wants his tattoo to see the light of day: Backstage at the <a href=#>2023 CMA Awards</a>, he explained to press that he decided to get it — and picked the specific design he did — for a couple of powerful, symbolic reasons.</p><p>"Maybe it was like, kids were on the way. I wanted to cling to my youth — let me get a massive chest tattoo," John joked. The guitarist and his wife, singer-songwriter Lucie Silvas, <a href=#>welcomed boy-girl twins</a> Arthur and Maybelle this March.</p><p>The tattoo was a marker during an important moment in time — when John was about to become a dad for the first time — and it also symbolized the journey of mental health and healing that Osborne has contended with over the last few years. <a href=#>He's spoken publicly about that battle at several occasions</a>, detailing a fight with depression and anxiety that was so debilitating it led him to consider quitting music and even posed a threat to his life.</p><p>"Symbolically, [the tattoo] is a sailor ship, and I've been very vocal about my mental health and a lot of the struggles I've had over the years," he continues. "[TJ Osborne] actually told me this quote after I'd gotten the sailor ship tattoo, [which] was, 'Smooth waters don't make good sailors.' It's an amazing philosophy and something I'll carry with me forever. I feel like I've become my best self in the most trying times of my life."</p><p>At the 2023 CMAs, John's brother and bandmate was also wearing an article of clothing that held important personal significance: T.J. rocked a glittering, bedazzled blazer that he had custom-made before playing Stagecoach in 2022.</p><p>"I always loved jackets like this, and when I was closeted I was very fearful that if I wore anything flashy it would bring questions or doubts," he explains. T.J.&nbsp;<a href=#>came out as gay to fans and the country music industry</a> in early 2021.</p><p>So a year later, he wanted to celebrated his ability to publicly be his authentic self by commissioning the sparkling, flashy Stagecoach outfit of his dreams. As for his decision to re-wear it on the CMA Awards? That was a little more practical.</p><p>"I wore it tonight mostly because it was very expensive and I wanted to reuse it," T.J. concludes with a laugh.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>The Best Country Singer From Every State</h2>Some states, like Oklahoma and Texas, are loaded with famous country singers.
