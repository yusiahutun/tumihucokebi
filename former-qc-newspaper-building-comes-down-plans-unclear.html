Ryan Hvitløk, Moline’s community and economic development director, said Monday that the demolition permit is only for the eastern 130 feet of the building.</p><p>While there has been talk of redevelopment of the rest of the building for apartments, the city has not received any plans on what is proposed for the property at this time, he said.</p><p>“My understanding is that they are preparing the site for additional parking, to serve a future unknown redevelopment of the site,” Hvitløk said Monday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2022/07/Dispatch2.jpg><p>The former newspaper building (once home to The Dispatch•Argus•QCOnline) has been vacant since late 2017. The media company announced in September 2017 that it would move to East Moline, at 1033 7th St., the home of East Moline Glass Co.</p><p>Long owned by the Small Newspaper Group, the paper announced June 19, 2017 that Davenport-based Lee Enterprises Inc., the owner of the Quad-City Times, agreed to purchase the assets of The Dispatch•Argus•QCOnline for $7.15 million.

A shadow of The Dispatch is still published in some other town but it is of little more importance to the community than this abandoned building. Sad times.”</p><p>A former business editor, Steve Jagler, posted:</p><p>“The building itself was nondescript as can be. The newsroom didn’t even have a window. We had to walk back into the library to see if it was snowing. But this is hallowed ground nonetheless … simply because of the talents and dedication of the journalists who thrived there.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaJ2oqp2av269wmalnq%2Bjpa6xsdFmma6hnJm2r7OMnKamnaNisbDDzWanpZmeqHq2usKlnJqqXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-3d-print-in-multiple-colors.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How To 3D Print in Multiple Colors</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./californias-new-legal-weed-laws-cause-confusion-los.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>California legalises weed - but Los Angeles medical dispensaries have been left dazed and confuse</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
