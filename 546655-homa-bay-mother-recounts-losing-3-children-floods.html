The rainfall was heavy, and I had to seek shelter, waiting for it to reduce before heading home. I didn't know the same rain would lead to the death of my children," Anyango narrated amid tears.<h2>Aftermath of Sindo floods</h2><p class=align-left>She told TUKO.co.ke that the waters also swept away the money she had saved as her children's school fees.</p>"I am stranded. I don't know where to start. Now, my children are in the morgue and need to be buried honourably. How I will take the remaining to school is another breaking story," she narrated.<p class=align-left>Anyango appealed to well-wishers and the government to help her bury her children and take the rest to school when the second term begins next week.</p>"I urgently need a roof over my head, even as I plan to bury my babies. The two surviving children are in Form One and Form Two and I'll need to pay fees to get them to school. I need help more because my husband is also in hospital," Anyango said.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7e21b36ebb0cbcab.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nakuru Woman Who Dropped Out of School, Became Homeless, Gains Admission to UK University</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Molly Onyango, a native of Rang'wa East sub-location within Sindo, was with Anyango on the farm on that fateful rain.</p><p class=align-left>She said they sheltered at her home, hoping the rain would reduce.</p>"The rain could not stop, and she (Anyango) decided to go and check on her children, who could be so lonely at that time, and I accompanied her. Just close to the river bank next to her home, we saw one of her children covered by stones and tree logs," Onyango recounted.<p class=align-left>Onyango recalled how she struggled to hold Anyango, who wanted to cross the swollen river to rescue her child.</p>"I had to pull her back and firmly hold her because the raging waters would have swept her too," she recalled.<p class=align-left>John Odayo, Anyango's neighbour, explained that one of the children was swept to his home and was found dead after the heavy rains.</p>"It was shocking to find out that her child had been swept to my homestead by the waters.
