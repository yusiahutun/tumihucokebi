In 2022 there were 17 of them, <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>according to a database</a>, compiled by multiple media organizations.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ten were murder-suicides, and 14 were shootings. The database defines a mass killing as four or more people slain, not including the assailant.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sequatchie, Tennessee,&nbsp;is one of more than 30 communities sent reeling by a family mass killing in the last two years, a list that includes communities of wealth and poverty and spares no race or class.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A family mass killing — where four or more people were killed, not including the perpetrator — happened each of the last two years in places as <a style=font-weight:700 class=class href=#>large as Houston</a> or as small as <a style=font-weight:700 class=class href=#>Casa Grande, Arizona.</a>&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Motives can remain speculative in family killings in which assailants take their own lives, but police often cite financial or relationship issues as the causes.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Family mass killings immediately capture the attention of people in a community, but rarely garner the level of national attention received by mass killings at schools, places of worship or restaurants, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University who has studied familicides and mass killings for decades.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Fox, who helped compile and maintains the database for the AP and USA Today, said that's because it doesn't carry the same kind of fear with the public. He noted police often issue messages saying there is no danger to the public shortly after the killings are discovered.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It's a nice safe community, but family massacres are independent of the crime rate in the local area,' he said. 'We are talking about internal factors, and I think that's why it's hard for people to see themselves in these situations and why the response is to mourn instead of fear.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Family mass killings are in fact the most common type of mass killing, making up about 45 percent of the 415 mass shootings since 2006, according to the database. They happen twice as frequently as mass shootings in which members of the public are killed.</p><img id=i-81dd3b5f31b93f3 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/06/22/16/69615375-12223355-Michael_Haight_42_fatally_shot_his_wife_her_mother_and_the_coupl-a-7_1687446422153.jpg height=621 width=634 alt="Michael Haight, 42, fatally shot his wife, her mother and the couple's five kids after he was investigated for child abuse in one of the most infamous murder suicides in recent years" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Michael Haight, 42, fatally shot his wife, her mother and the couple's five kids after he was investigated for child abuse in one of the most infamous murder suicides in recent years&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Most, but not all, involve handguns, only about a third involve households with a previous occurrence of domestic violence and most of the assailants have no violent history or criminal past, Fox said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There is no governmental agency tracking murder-suicides nationally, so a few years ago policy analysts at the Violence Policy Center — a nonprofit educational organization that conducts research and public education on violence in the U.S. — began tracking details from news accounts to produce an annual report.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The latest version from 2020 looked at murder-suicides including many mass killings during the first six months of 2019.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The study found 81 percent of murder-suicides happened at home and 65 percent involved intimate partners.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The study also found that among murder-suicides where more than three people aside from the assailant were killed, six of the 10 during those six months were incidents in which a person killed their children, partner and themselves.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Fox said most of the killings fall into two categories. The first is murder by proxy, in which the killer is motivated by anger or resentment and kills the children who are seen as an extension of their partner.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The second is suicide by proxy motivated by despondency or depression, most often a job loss, and the assailant kills the children as an extension of themselves.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He wants to spare them the misery of living in this awful world,' Fox said. 'Over the years, there's been an eclipse in community. There was a time decades ago if you had trouble feeding your family or if you had lost your job, neighbors would come over with casseroles and they would offer emotional support. Many people don't know their neighbors these days.'</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Bc36RbGpubV%2BBvLa10qKYp5ldpa60wM6rZKygn6TBtHnWop2eZZuesbR5066pp6GenHqowc1mp6ikmZiybr%2FAsmWhrJ2h</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./magic-moments-abound-at-jensen-beach-nuptials.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Magic Moments Abound at Jensen Beach Nuptials</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./whos-richest-red-hot-chili-peppers-net-worths-ranked-how.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Whos richest of the Red Hot Chili Peppers?
