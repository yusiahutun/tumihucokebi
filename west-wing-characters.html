Over the course of seven seasons from 1999 to 2006, the show kept us hooked with its irresistible mix of government intrigue and juicy drama. The diverse ensemble cast was strong enough to win over even those of us who didn’t have a personal interest in politics, and seeing the inner workings of the presidential office was endlessly fascinating.</p><p>Even years after it wrapped up, the award-winning show remains politically relevant and prescient. Here’s what President Bartlet, C.J. Cregg and the rest of our favorite West Wing characters have been up to since they left the White House.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-1305782-edited.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Martin Sheen as President Josiah “Jed” Bartlet</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/1.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Sheen</a> played Josiah “Jed” Bartlet, the President of the United States. The show captured all of Bartlet’s highs and lows, from unexpectedly winning the Democratic Party nomination to privately battling multiple sclerosis.&nbsp;Deeply intelligent, witty and no-nonsense, Bartlet remains one of the most compelling fictional presidents we’ve seen.</p><p>Sheen had a long and impressive career behind him when he was cast in The West Wing. Born Ramón Antonio Gerard Estévez, he began acting in the ’60s, appearing consistently in TV episodes throughout the decade. In 1973, he broke through with his starring role in the gorgeously shot lovers-on-the-run drama Badlands. He won further acclaim in 1979 when he played a Vietnam-era army captain in Apocalypse Now, a film widely considered to be one of the greatest of all time.</p><p>Sheen became known for playing political roles: He played Robert F. Kennedy in a 1974 TV special and John F. Kennedy in a 1983 miniseries and White House Counsel John Dean in a 1979 miniseries. He also played a fictional presidential candidate in the 1983 thriller The Dead Zone and narrated the controversial film JFK in 1991. In 1995, Sheen played the White House Chief of Staff in The American President. The film was written by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aaron Sorkin</a>, who would go on to create The West Wing and write much of its signature fast-paced dialogue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-1309925-edited.jpg><p>After The West Wing ended, Sheen had notable roles in films like The Departed, The Amazing Spider-Man and Judas and the Black Messiah. From 2012 to 2014 he appeared alongside his son, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charlie Sheen</a>, in the sitcom Anger Management.</p><p>Most recently, Sheen, now 83, starred as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jane Fonda</a>‘s ex-husband in the popular <a href=#>Netflix</a> comedy series Grace and Frankie.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>John Spencer as Leo McGarry, The West Wing Characters</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/2.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Spencer</a> played Leo McGarry, President Bartlet’s close personal friend and the White House Chief of Staff.

His role in The West Wing would become his best-remembered work, but sadly it was also his final project, as he died of a heart attack at age 58 in 2005.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bradley Whitford as Joshua Lyman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/3.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bradley Whitford</a> played Josh Lyman, the charming, sharp-as-a-tack White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>The Juilliard-trained star began acting in the ’80s, making appearances in soap operas and movies like Adventures in Babysitting and the sequel to Revenge of the Nerds.

The West Wing brought him a new level of fame, and after the show ended, he remained a TV fixture with shows of varying success, including The Good Guys, Trophy Wife, Happyish, Transparent and Perfect Harmony. His pitch-perfect performance in the groundbreaking 2017 horror movie Get Out sparked much conversation and even became <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">meme fodder</a>. Whitford’s other notable film roles include The Cabin in the Woods, Saving Mr. Banks, The Post, Godzilla: King of the Monsters and tick, tick… BOOM!</p><p>Now 64, Whitford most recently played Commander Joseph Lawrence in the futuristic dystopian drama The Handmaid’s Tale.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Allison Janney as C.J.

Cregg was a breath of fresh air. While she was frequently condescended to by her male peers, she proved her savviness time and again, and ultimately became Chief of Staff.</p><p>Prior to The West Wing, Janney started out with small roles and stage performances in the early ’90s. She appeared in soap opera episodes and movies like Walking and Talking, Private Parts, The Ice Storm, 10 Things I Hate About You and Drop Dead Gorgeous. Sorkin was inspired to cast Janney after seeing her in the 1998 politically-themed film Primary Colors.</p><p>Janney was originally something of a character actress who primarily took on supporting roles, but The West Wing made her a star. After the show ended, she acted in popular movies like Hairspray, Juno and The Help. In 2018, she won the Oscar for Best Supporting actress for her role as the notorious ice skater Tonya Harding’s abusive mother in I, Tonya.</p><p>Now 64, Janney took a sharp turn from The West Wing when she starred in the sitcom Mom from 2013 to 2021. Her other recent credits include To Leslie, Lou, The People We Hate at the Wedding and The Creator.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Richard Schiff as Toby Ziegler, The West Wing characters</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/then-and-now2.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Richard Schiff</a> played the White House Communications Director, Toby Ziegler, who wrote many of Bartlet’s speeches, including inaugural addresses and State of the Union addresses. Though he was fired from the administration during a leak investigation, he was ultimately pardoned for his crimes at the series’ end.</p><p>Initially, Schiff wanted to be a director, and he began his career by directing off-Broadway plays. In the late ’80s, he moved into acting, with bit parts in movies and a handful of TV appearances on shows like L.A. Law and Murphy Brown. Schiff grew fed up with all the small, single-episode roles he was taking, but his fortunes turned when he was cast in an episode of the show High Incident, which was produced by none other than <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Steven Spielberg</a>. Spielberg was so impressed by Schiff’s performance that he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cast him in The Lost World: Jurassic Park</a> in 1997. A couple years later, The West Wing would give Schiff his most prominent role.</p><p>After The West Wing, Schiff had recurring roles in a variety of shows, including Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior, NCIS, House of Lies, Ballers and The Affair. Now 68, he currently stars in the medical drama The Good Doctor. In 2022, he returned to the White House as Secretary of State in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check in with more beloved TV drama casts below!</strong></p><p><a href=#>‘Everwood’ Cast Then and Now: Catch Up With the Beloved Stars Today!</a></p><p><a href=#>‘JAG’ Cast Then and Now: Catch Up With the Stars of the Hit ’90s Military Drama</a></p><p><a href=#>‘Lost’ Cast Then and Now: Take a Trip Back to The Island and See Where the Stars Are Today</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Sons of Anarchy’ Cast Then and Now: Get Up to Speed With the Beloved Biker Gang</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonKeslafBorXNppynrF%2BssrTAjLCgp59dmLWivsCcq56qow%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./duchess-sophie-wears-hermes-scarf-for-first-time.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Duchess Sophie just wore a Herms hair bow - and it's a royal masterpiece</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./65c2b60222601d2a168b4591-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Resultados Lotera Nacional martes 6 de febrero 2024: lista Sorteo Mayor 3917</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
