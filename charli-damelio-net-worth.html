Her older sister, <a href=# rel=noopener>Dixie D’Amelio</a>, is also a TikTok creator, with more than 50 million followers.

That’s weird,'” she said. “So I wouldn’t tell people. Someone would come up to me and maybe ask for a picture and then someone else would be like, ‘Oh, how do they know you? Like, what are you from?’ I was like, ‘Oh, I do social media. I don’t know,’ and I would get super uncomfortable.”</p><p>She continued, Then my friends would be like, ‘Hey, I saw you on my ‘For You’ page. That’s so weird.’ It was a lot of that until I felt comfortable to be like, ‘Yeah, I’m on TikTok.’ I just started posting videos, not really caring what anyone else thought, because I was having fun making them. But since then, I have switched to an online one-on-one schooling program that’s great for me because I tend to have a pretty busy schedule. So I’m able to work my hours of schooling around that and I can do them a little bit earlier and get them done. I’ve also been able to make a lot more friends out in California.”</p><p>So how much is Charli D’Amelio’s net worth exactly? Read on for what she’s worth and how much she makes on TikTok.

I didn’t have an account, so I was just dancing on their phones and I’d be like, ‘Oh, can you send me that? That’s so cool,'” Charli told Variety in 2020. “Eventually I decided to make my own account because I was having so much fun making all of these dance videos with my friends. I got the app, I started dancing, my videos started getting a little bit more popular on the app and a lot has happened since then. Now I’m here getting to do stuff like this.”</p><p>Her first viral video was in July 2019 when she posted a “duet” of her dancing with TikTok user Move With Joy.

Most of Charli’s earnings came from advertising sponsorships with brands like Invisalign, Morphe cosmetics and Dunkin’ Donuts. The earnings also came from Charli’s 2021 Hollister collaboration, Social Tourist, with her older sister, Dixie D’Amlio. Hollister’s CEO, Fran Horowitz, credited Social Tourist for contributing to 10 percent of Hollister’s sales through September 2021. Charli’s earnings also come from her family’s Hulu reality TV show, The D’Amelio Show, as well as her and Dixie’s 10-episode show on Snap.

Charli’s also made money from her Charli merchandise, which she launched in May 2020.

According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth,</a> Charli is worth $20 million, which includes the money she makes from TikTok, as well as various sponsorship deals. Celebrity Net Worth reports that Charli makes at least $100,000 per sponsored TikTok post, as well as $1 million for her Super Bowl ad with Sabra Hummus. Charli was also a contestant on Dancing With the Stars season 31 in 2022 alongside her mother, Heidi D’Amelio.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a> in 2022, Charli explained how her profitable Dunkin’ Donuts collaboration came from her free promotion of the brand. “The Dunkin Donuts collaboration came about after a lot of free promotion,” she said. “For a while, everyone thought I was getting paid. But I was not. I just shamelessly promoted and promoted because I really wanted to work with them. And then they finally gave me the opportunity and I immediately took it. And since then, we’ve come out with two of my own drinks on the menu and sold-out cold brew nationwide. It was a really big hit for me. And it was a really great feeling seeing all of that come together. It was definitely a lot of my determination to work with Dunkin Donuts.”</p><p>She continued, “Still to this day, there are companies and brands that I’ll never work with because of the initial reaction; when they thought that I was just going to be that same person forever. I’ve been able to find companies that respect me and respect what I do and appreciate what I do. I would so much rather work with those people that not only respect me as a creator but also respect me as a human. And I’m a lot happier working with brands like that.”</p><p>Charli also explained how she and Dixie came up with the idea for Social Tourist.“My sister and I worked with Hollister and came up with Social Tourist. In the beginning it was a lot of Hollister’s creative team teaching us how to create a clothing line. And, with time, it’s been more in the hands of Dixie and I when it comes to colors and fabrics and silhouettes. Now you can see, with every new drop that we have, that’s it’s very ‘us,'” she said. “It took a very long time to develop. You can see the difference from the first drop to the last drop. It’s a whole new thing. We also did a rebrand this year. We restarted the Instagram page and started a new, less commercial, vibe. It’s a little more fun; less perfect. We shoot all of our content on an iPhone. It’s been a lot of hard work but it’s been a lot of fun. And it’s super rewarding to see people out wearing the clothes that you made.”</p><p>In 2022, Charli also launched her first fragrance, Born Dreamer, which is sold at Ulta. “I’ve always loved the idea behind having a signature scent, so I was so excited with the opportunity to work with Forma on creating my own perfume. There is something about having a fragrance that makes me feel so put together once I put it on,” she said. She continued, “Not only was I excited to create my own signature scent but a brand that I truly feel encompasses me and my generation. We put sustainability at the forefront of our packaging design and I’m so excited to have created a brand that is doing something to make a small difference in protecting our planet.”</p><p>Charli D’Amelio’s net worth also includes what she makes from her and her family’s partnership with the Lightricks, a photo and video editing platform. “The Lightricks app makes it a lot easier for creators, who might not be as tech savvy, to be able to make their videos and their photos look so much better: There are more interesting cuts, there’s things in the background, there’s text, there’s so many things that you can add without having to do 40 hours of research on how to use an editing app. And you just have to click one button. It just makes it all so easy for everyone to use,” she said.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The D’Amelio Show</a> is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hulu.</a></p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
