The method that most programmers use to figure out which language to learn is that they consider what they want to do career-wise, or what they want to build.</p><p>That, in turn, determines which language (or series of languages) they need to learn. So, look up the types of jobs you are interested in, look at their job descriptions, see which languages they require. From there, find an app that's compatible with the language(s) you'll be learning and jump on in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, the most common computer programming languages you are likely to see are Python, JavaScript, and Java. And, you can take some solace in the fact that, although programming languages are different and are designed to perform differing tasks, their logic is mostly the same no matter what language you use, and <i>that</i> is ultimately what you need to learn.</p><h2 id=the-best-apps-for-learning-how-to-code>The Best Apps for Learning How to Code</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/727cbf8a.png> <a href=#>Iurii Stepanov/Shutterstock.com</a><p>Not all learn-to-code apps and websites are created equal.
