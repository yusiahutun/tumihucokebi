It appears to be a mixture of Los Angeles-style <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">mindfulness</span></a>, good old healthy eating and regular exercise (and, who knows, a few surgical interventions?).<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Moore herself says that looking on the bright side of life has had a major beneficial impact on her appearance (something, surely, we can all do).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/08/0851636f-78d7-4cb6-a9ba-a069f25e6b58_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I do believe that when we hold upset, anger, hurt, pain or bitterness, it ages us and we wear it,” she said in an interview with W magazine. “That isn’t to say we are always going to feel happy. But it’s important not to hold on to things.”</p>Exercise-wise, she credits daily <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">yoga</span></a> and a technique called the Mirror method. Mirror is a hi-tech workout product that bills itself as an “interactive home gym”, according to Mirror founder and former chief executive Brynn Putnam.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Installed in your house, it looks like a normal mirror, but streams live and on-demand fitness classes from a variety of workout genres – like Peloton, but without the bike.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/08/063a49ea-afbb-4fca-8497-801fc33c8d21_7619c276.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I guess I would think of it like this,” she said in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar. “It was really important to me to have natural childbirth because I didn’t want to miss a moment. And with that I experienced pain. So part of being sober is, I don’t want to miss a moment of life, of that texture, even if that means being in some pain.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Having been in the public eye since she was in her 20s, Moore is, of course, familiar with the more painful side effects of fame. She has become something of an icon, and with many images of her from the 20th century in particular having become globally famous, there is a pressure to look a certain way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/08/542e04ec-7430-4e8d-81e9-95d5b56770c9_f4d89add.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/08/a1ed2615-5804-487b-8c17-47969bb62d96_cec7db59.jpg>She was already famous when she married actor <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Bruce Willis</span></a> in 1987; that, and the release of Ghost in 1990, propelled her into the big leagues.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 1990s began with what is probably the most iconic image of Moore – her appearance on the cover of Vanity Fair, naked while heavily pregnant with her daughter Scout in 1991.</p>“I remember it very well,” Moore said in a conversation with <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Naomi Campbell</span></a> for the supermodel’s No Filter series on YouTube.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I understand what impact it had on the world. On women, on our permission to embrace ourselves in a pregnant state. But it was a moment that I was taking to really be in myself and be expressing myself, and not trying to be anything other than me.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her career grew rapidly after this and she starred in some of the highest grossing films of the decade: in all of them, she played the beautiful main character and her thick, dark hair was a major part of her identity as a global sex symbol.</p>This is why the world was shocked when she shaved it all off for her role in 1997 film GI Jane. When she, Willis and two of their children arrived at the Striptease premiere in 1996, Moore had a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">buzz cut</span></a> (filming on GI Jane had just begun) and the world was captivated.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By the time of the GI Jane premiere later that year, the actress’ hair had grown into a pixie cut that she would keep for five years and which would become a major international trend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/08/045a2721-2f49-4669-b95e-7271a88900fa_091da098.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/08/1c25094c-7b60-4869-8b3a-ba116d79f583_4085906a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By the early 2000s, Moore’s relationship with Willis had broken down and she was now involved with the much younger Ashton Kutcher. Her entire look was transformed in this period.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gone were the pixie cut and plunging necklines and in their place were her now trademark long, dark locks, a walnut tan and a series of shorter and shorter minidresses.</p>Now this is the look Moore is known for. At certain points she has arguably taken her adherence to it too far, most notably on the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Fendi</span></a> catwalk last year, where guests were shocked by her appearance.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/08/22d0fb07-3004-409b-84bf-21706ab14afe_db610c23.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In what looked to some like the result of too much plastic surgery, her cheekbones protruded almost ghoulishly from her face as she sashayed up and down the runway in an off-the-shoulder dress.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">People close to her have claimed it was the lighting or her make-up that caused her to look like that – but clearly Moore took note; more recent photos have shown her back to her usual dazzling self.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/11/08/bfb2830b-c5d0-4baf-b7b0-bb9ce46bbc95_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One shot in particular that she shared recently showed her looking more beautiful than ever in a black bikini with long, glossy hair.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If this is 60, then bring it on …</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlkpqutsDYaJirrJmYuaZ7kmpwcXBla3ylscyiZKann6eybsDUq6Wippdig3F51qGYratdqLKkvsStZKGnnKHGuLvOnWSsrJGnwG6%2FxJ6koqaXocZusdOeqaeZnGLGsMHToQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./evanescence.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Evanescence</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./breaking-jill-gascoine-dead-gentle-21945694.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jill Gascoine dead: The Gentle Touch actress dies aged 83 after Alzheimer's battle</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
