This is common when considering the time of year, but if you’re wondering <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">how the full moon in Cancer will affect your zodiac sign</a>, embrace your feelings fully. Whether in the past or present, your emotional experiences tell a story that’ll continue to shape your individual reality. The truth isn’t always pretty, so don’t be afraid to acknowledge what’s being illuminated to you at this time. More importantly, always remember that your feelings are valid.</p><p>Governed by <a href=#>the ever-changing moon</a>, Cancer is symbolic of the divine mother archetype. It can be as nurturing as it is destructive, similar to a mother’s womb and how it has the power to hold the infinite cycle of death and rebirth at its core. This cardinal water sign encourages you to look within and discover what truly nourishes you from the inside out. After all, in addition to representing themes surrounding the home and family, Cancer can speak about the way you mother yourself when your own mother isn’t around to take care of you. The maternal side of your family holds the key to this water sign’s sorcery, as it carries a sea of ancestral wisdom, matriarchal magic, and kitchen witchery for herbal remedies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/fullmooninlibra.gif?w=650"><p>Heightened intuition is inevitable during this lunar phase, but what is illuminated cannot be denied when the moon peaks in its sign of rulership, which also happens to be Cancer. Psychically overwhelming and cloaked in heavy nostalgia, this year’s full moon in Cancer will adorn the night sky on December 26 at 7:33 p.m. ET and via 4 degrees of this cardinal water sign. It’s no coincidence that this lunation is happening during the holiday season, as we are called to take a closer look at our family dynamics and emotional patterns. With the support of a harmonious sextile to Jupiter—Greater Benefic, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the planet of abundance, expansion, and spiritual wisdom</a>—we are simultaneously reminded of the safety within our heart space. This could also be a celebration of your emotional journey thus far.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>The full moon in Cancer takes place on December 26 at 7:33 p.m. ET.</p></figure><p>Whether it be an influx of emotions that feel like ocean waves above your head or a newfound perspective on past experiences you’ve deeply repressed, it’s time to unleash the floodgates. Jupiter will harmonize <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>with the sun in Capricorn</a>, highlighting everything from your personal values and traditions, which may continue to validate your emotions. Saturn is also a key player, as it sextiles Jupiter and forms a steady trine with the moon. This is about taking accountability for your actions, feelings, and perhaps the pain stemming from your past. There is also strong paternal energy, especially when considering the influence of Capricorn season and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Saturn—its planetary ruler</a>—so you could be wrapping up a previous cycle surrounding your family structure or unit.</p><p>On the dark side, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Mercury retrograde</a> will be in close proximity with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>aggressive Mars in Sagittarius</a>. Despite the healing frequency stemming from this lunation, we are also prone to hot-headed outbursts and brutally honest conversations that may hurt people’s feelings in the process. Be discerning with your delivery, and think twice before you start a wildfire with your words.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-the-full-moon-in-cancer-2023-will-affect-each-zodiac-sign>How the Full Moon in Cancer 2023 Will Affect Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>If your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>sun sign</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>moon sign</a>, or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a> falls under any of the following zodiac signs, the upcoming full moon will be healing and deeply illuminating.

Despite not being comfortable in your vulnerability, it’s probably best to wave your white flag instead of doing everything in your power to hold up that Martian suit of armor. There’s no denying the flashbacks that are alive and breathing in your emotional memory and subconscious mind. Why bother resisting it? The traditions you’ve created are a reflection of the values instilled in your heart, even those that may have originated in a place of pain. You’ve built a stable home within and around you, and this is all the more reason to celebrate. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.8525896414343><h2>Taurus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Taurus.png><p>Being a fixed earth sign can explain why you’re so remarkably contained, but there’s only so much you can keep to yourself, Taurus. Hovering over your third house of communication, neighbors, and immediate circles, everything from your thoughts to your conversations will be heavy with mood under this year’s full moon in Cancer. If you’re having mixed emotions about a relative or struggling to address conflicted belief systems, consider this an opportunity to speak your truth and have a long-awaited conversation with a loved one. With the support of bountiful Jupiter glimmering through your sign, your newfound values are grounded and supported. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.2927272727273><h2>Gemini</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Gemini.png><p>Be sure to pencil in more time for self-care and self-love, Gemini. After all, you’ve singlehandedly gone above and beyond, building and curating a safe haven you can call your own, especially when looking back to the new moon in Cancer on July 17 as a starting point. Emotionally, monetarily, and perhaps even aesthetically, December’s full moon puts a spotlight on your efforts and overall harvest, which naturally reflect on your sense of self-worth. If you’re confronted with uncomfortable conversations surrounding your connection with a significant other, don’t lose sight of this full-circle moment, especially those that don’t contribute to your sense of stability. Let’s not forget Mercury is still retrograde. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.3238095238095><h2>Cancer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cancer.png><p>Your heart is full under the moon, Cancer. If you’re flooded with emotions, there’s no reason to hold back from expressing your deepest sentiments. On the contrary, feelings are more likely to surface at this time, some of which you had yet to acknowledge until this very moment. If you experienced neglect or apathy from a community of individuals once upon a time, this lunation could be equally as triggering as it is healing for your inner child. Experiencing that sense of belonging, surrounded by loved ones, could feel bittersweet. Some would even call this “anemoia,” which is a deep longing and nostalgia for a past you’ve never lived. Celebrate how far you’ve come, even if that consists of you looking back to the beginning, where it all started. Being present in the moment could turn out to be more rewarding than you realize. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.71791613723><h2>Leo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Leo.png><p>You can run but can’t hide from the truth, Leo. There’s only so much you can repress, disregard, and sweep under the rug, especially when all of the joy and pain you’ve experienced continues to linger in the depths of your subconscious. This month’s full moon in Cancer will illuminate your solitude-seeking 12th house of privacy, surrender, self-sabotage, and unconscious patterns. Although you’re one to wear your heart on your sleeve, allowing your feelings to flow is easier said than done, but an opportunity to heal nonetheless. A supercut of could of, should of, would of, it’s OK to grieve what you cannot change, but don’t lose sight of what you’ve gained in the process. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.8621523579202><h2>Virgo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Virgo.png><p>The holidays are always an excuse to gather with your loved ones, and with December’s full moon activating your 11th house of associations, networks, and community affairs, it’s all the more reason to celebrate the friends who have become family over the years. Contrarily, you may come to find that a group where you once experienced a sense of belonging no longer resonates with you and your newfound values. The decision to start new traditions or perhaps cut ties with this community of individuals could very well tug on your heartstrings, but the intuitive decision to move forward is the only validation you need. Conversations are bound to heat up on the home front, so try to steer away from the Mercury retrograde chaos. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.3576923076923><h2>Libra</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Libra.png><p>Your sheer radiance is impossible to resist under the full moon, especially since it’s reaching its peak via the most public point in your chart. However, this lunation could bring a professional project or career endeavor full circle in addition to the attention you’re bound to receive. It’s important to take a step back and reflect on whether your path of choice is in alignment with your values, traditions, and emotional foundation. A female authority figure or prominent parent could also be a key player at this time, especially one you hold in high regard. A significant partnership could also come into play, but you may experience conflict with regard to financial values and belief systems in the process. Confrontation is almost inevitable, but you’re a charming diplomat, so do what you do best. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9112709832134><h2>Scorpio</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Scorpio.png><p>Nothing is supposed to stay the same, but your personal progress is a reflection of your spiritual growth. When looking back at your childhood and early experiences, reflect on how your perception of home and family has evolved since. December’s full moon in Cancer will touch down on your expansive ninth house of self-discovery, and a newfound outlook arrives just in time for this brand-new chapter. The decision to rekindle a relationship could also result from this lunation, except that you’re choosing to be more vocal and expressive about your needs and desires moving forward. There’s no such thing as perfect, so don’t be discouraged if things don’t go according to plan. Everything’s falling into place as it should. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.7780373831776><h2>Sagittarius</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sagittarius.png><p>Sharing is caring, even when you’re not necessarily in the mood to share, Sagittarius. Meeting a significant other halfway could be emotionally triggering under December’s full moon, as it will ignite your eighth house of intimate unions and energetic exchanges, but they weren’t lying when they said, “You get what you give.” If there’s been a lack of balance or perhaps injustices surrounding your connection to family, you’re seeing the repercussions firsthand. Fortunately, with the support of your celestial ruler, Jupiter, and taskmaster Saturn, you have the confidence to commit to this new reality and set ground rules moving forward. Also, think before you say something you regret because Mercury retrograde is bound to hog the mic.&nbsp;<a href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.8541392904074><h2>Capricorn</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Capricorn.png><p>The idea of togetherness is top of mind for you at this time, Capricorn. If you’ve been missing someone you hold dear to your heart or are perhaps contemplating whether to commit to a brand-new partnership, it’s thanks to the full moon in Cancer, as it will ignite your seventh house of relationships, companionship, and other people. You could feel torn about mixing business with pleasure at this time, considering the personal bond you share with someone vs. the way it could potentially affect the structure of your foundation. Although you’re more likely to prioritize logic over intuition, following your heart and leading with love never felt so good. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.8661971830986><h2>Aquarius</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aquarius.png><p>Post-holiday detoxes don’t always have to turn into a diet, Aquarius. Your mental health is emphasized under December’s full moon in Cancer, so something as simple as taking a step back to decompress from the Christmas chaos will suffice. Nevertheless, it’s important to be mindful of what’s being brought to your attention regarding your mental, physical, and spiritual well-being during this time. This is especially true with the moon peaking in your sixth house of health and in a sign like Cancer, it’s important to be discerning with what you ingest and whether it contributes to your nourishment. The same goes for your daily duties and general occupation, so reflect on what needs to be integrated into your routine for your highest good. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.8477366255144><h2>Pisces</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Pisces.png><p>Let your inner child come out to play, Pisces. A new set of values and beliefs could influence your definition of joy this holiday season, as this month’s full moon will ignite your fifth house of love, children, passion projects, and self-expression. It’s been a strenuous couple of months (thanks to taskmaster Saturn in your sign), but you’re also starting to see the fruits of your labor, and there’s nothing more gratifying than that. A sudden epiphany could also validate an emotional experience you locked away in your heart once upon a time. Allow these moments to serve as teachers if not some much-needed validation.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfnby4ecWuo6VlnaS8r3nCmqWcnaJirqeyxJyrZp2RmLVuxs6doJqbXai2qLqMnZycnZ2XsrN5kWlpbGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nfl-draft-salaries.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>NFL Rookie Salaries 2024:How Much First-Year Football Players Make</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./charlottevacations.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Charlotte enjoys an extended summer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
