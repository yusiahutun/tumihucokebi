The birth of Andre Morgan Rami Ayew, better known as Dede Ayew. He is the Ghana national team captain and he plays for the Qatari club Al Sadd.</strong></p><h2><span id=Net_Worth_of_Inaya_Parents>Net Worth of Inaya Parents</span></h2><p>Inaya is currently completing her education while enjoying a privileged lifestyle provided by her parents. We now know the net worth of her father, one of the wealthiest players in Ghana, Andre. His net worth as of November 2022 is <strong>$15 million.</strong></p><h2><span id=About_her_parents>About her parents</span></h2><p>The Ayews, Andre, and Yvonne are her parents. Her mother, Yvonne Ayew, is a businesswoman. She is the founder and chief executive officer of the women’s Kynamah and Kyna collections. The firm seeks to create apparel that makes women feel liberated. In 2014, her parents got her name tattooed on their wrists.</p><p>Andre discusses dealing with the pressure of being the son of a famous football player.</p><p>He is the son of three-time African player of the year and FIFA 100 member Abedi “Pele” Ayew, and both of his uncles were professional footballers. He was born into it as the son of one of the greatest players in Africa.</p><p>Growing up as the son of a football star, Andre was subjected to a great deal of pressure.</p><p>Andre stated on a podcast that he grew up under pressure, and because he was unable to change the situation, it became a part of him. In addition, they had high expectations of him because of his father, which was difficult.</p><p>Even if he worked hard and succeeded, his name would come after his father’s, which was first difficult for him to accept. His principal objective was to establish his reputation. He worked diligently and resolutely, taking criticism in stride.</p><p>He stated that having a father who was the greatest African player of all time guarantees that you will be envious, even if you have done nothing to them.</p><p>Andre believes he has dealt with all that has transpired in his life. He feels that athletes who cannot handle pressure will not be able to compete at the highest level.</p><p>At the age of 12, he became aware of the pressure since his entire family expected him to perform at the highest level and play for the Ghana national team, which was a good thing.</p><p>At the same time, he was under a great deal of strain, since everyone was watching him and telling him he had to succeed.</p><p>He was questioned at a young age if he could be like his father, if he could play like his father, etc. It became Andre’s responsibility to prove to everyone that he could.</p><h2><span id=Andre_likes_Ghanaian_music>Andre likes Ghanaian music</span></h2><p>Andre appreciates music, especially Ghanaian music. He adores R&B and hip-hop and follows the majority of Ghanaian R&B, rappers, and singers. Shatta Wale is his preferred artist.</p><p>According to him, Wale’s song has touched the hearts of Ghanaians, and he is someone whose thoughts and attitudes were previously misunderstood but are now understood.</p><p>Stonebwoy and Sarkodie are his other favorite artists, in addition to Wale. Andre is thrilled with the expansion of Ghanaian music.</p><p>He considers it a tremendous success for them and encourages them to continue their excellent job in the sector. The same should be done with music.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Why Ed Skrein Left Game Of Thrones And His Family Life"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":37248,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/why-ed-skrein-left-game-of-thrones-and-his-family-life/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/why-ed-skrein-left-game-of-thrones-and-his-family-life/"}{"1":65}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Why Ed Skrein Left Game Of Thrones And His Family Life</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity Daughter</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>All About Meera Jaffrey | Net Worth, Bio, Height</a></h3>Meera Jaffrey is the daughter of American actress Madhur Jaffrey, who has received multiple awards throughout her career.
