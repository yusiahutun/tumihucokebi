I originally saw the line’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram</a> page full of gorgeous obscure images and knew something big was coming. After all, this was founded&nbsp;by the same people who made Fashion Week feel cooler and more relevant&nbsp;through <a href=# rel=nofollow>Milk Made</a>,&nbsp;a set of shows held downtown that&nbsp;represent a variety of under-the-radar designers. If they could do <a href=# id=auto-tag_makeup data-tag=makeup>makeup</a> and skin care in the same way—making it feel fun, fresh, and different—I was already sold.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/marykay_sc.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1399819542.jpg><p>Then I visited the website and saw that the models looked like cool girls I’d want to hang out with, rather than conventionally airbrushed models with pretty, if generic, <a href=# id=auto-tag_beauty-3 data-tag=beauty-3>beauty</a>.&nbsp;The products officially launched this week, and you can get them via&nbsp;Milk’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>website</a>, at <a href=# rel=nofollow>Sephora</a>, and at&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Urban Outfitters</a>.</p><p>The all-important packaging is spot-on&nbsp;and definitely gives a nod to the ’90s. Think: roller-ball blushes, push-up products, and colors and textures that look straight out of fashion’s favorite decade. Read on to see our review of the line, then shop each product mentioned in the order they appear.</p><p>This chisel tip on this eyeliner is ideal&nbsp;for creating a high-impact cat eye. I’ve always preferred using a marker for black eyeliner, but the angle of the tip makes this one a breeze to achieve drama. I wore it all day and even (accidentally!) slept in it, and it didn’t budge. Plus, there’s a bit of shine in the formula which I love and have yet to find in a felt-tip liner. The cute packaging makes it look like a highlighter.</p><p>The pearlescence of this shadow is super-pigmented, so you only need to dab a tiny smudge to get a smoky, creamy, colorful look. It comes in a thin tube making it super-portable, and I tested it out as a liner (using an angled brush), which gave me a very ’80s look. But Milk also encourages you to use your fingers for application. I recommend the shade Mermaid Parade, which is a sultry, shiny&nbsp;green.</p><p>Hands down, this is my favorite product from the line. The clicky pen delivers high shine (in a beige neutral or charcoal black) to your lids. The glossy-lid look is definitely one we’ve seen on the runway, but this is the first product I’ve liked to get the look IRL, short of using Vaseline. It works best over a skin-colored primer.</p><p>I was insanely excited to try a mascara that promised to last through an entire weekend. Unfortunately, the formula didn’t separate my lashes as much as I would have liked. Still, it did impart a deep hue on my lashes for the full weekend, but I ended up using another normal mascara on top to add volume and make it a little less clumpy.</p><p>This is honestly my new favorite brow pencil. The gel-like formula is something I’ve been looking for, since most pencils don’t allow me to add the arch I like without powder on top. It also lasts all day, and it’s waterproof.</p><p>I’m usually opposed to any lip product that comes in a pot (ugh, germs), but I was sold because of the velvety, plush texture. I used a lip brush, and the color was intense—it is a pigment, after all—and stayed on through a dinner and a glass of wine. The only problem: It’s pretty drying after application, but I found layering a clear lip balm underneath helps.</p><p>As soon as I swatched these colors on the back of my hand, I was psyched&nbsp;to try them. They’re about as pigmented as lipsticks come in truly interesting&nbsp;shades, ranging from a red-orange poppy to deep mauve. Unfortunately, they’re so drying that my lips felt like they were cracking—even after a fresh scrub and intensive balm.</p><p>Like the Eye Vinyl, I think this is one of the line’s more innovative, fashion-forward products.&nbsp;You can apply the gloss—which is thick and not unlike clear honey—anywhere you want, but I’ve been&nbsp;dabbing it on&nbsp;as a natural highlighter along&nbsp;my cheekbones.</p><p>I was afraid this stick would be too dark at first—it has a deep bronzy shade—but it’s not. The twist-up packaging is adorable, and the highlighter gives just the right about of glow (think: candlelight) while also moisturizing.</p><p>This product shares the same packaging as the highlighter and might just be my new favorite way to moisturize. I’ve been using it as sort of a primer before applying foundation. Beware, it’s seriously oily, but it’s precisely&nbsp;what my dried-out winter skin needs. I also like to use it on cheekbones (like Face Gloss) as an alternative to highlighter.</p><p><a href=#>As a&nbsp;hair-dye addict</a>&nbsp;who lives off of dry shampoo, I had high hopes for this. Unfortunately, it left white residue on my hair (which took a good amount of brushing to come out), and my personal opinion is that&nbsp;it’s fairly&nbsp;pricey ($14) for one measly ounce.</p><p>The idea of a roller-ball moisturizer makes me nostalgic for late-’90s makeup and lip balms (Bonne Bell, anyone?), and&nbsp;that’s a good thing. The Sunshine Oil smells divine&nbsp;(with ingredients like grapeseed, avocado, grapefruit peel, tangerine peel, mandarin orange peel, and l<span class=morecontent><span class=readmore-description>emon peel)</span></span>&nbsp;and is designed to be used anywhere. It claims to brighten skin, though&nbsp;for me, it just makes my skin softer.</p><h2></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2htYWyBcYGOpqClo12irqyx1Klkq52mnrK4ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-get-roadside-assistance-using-alexa.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Get Roadside Assistance Using Alexa</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./halloween-nails.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>42 Halloween Nail Art Designs for 2023</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
