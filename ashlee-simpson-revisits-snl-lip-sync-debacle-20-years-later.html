Despite telling the team she was not going to perform, the singer claimed she was asked to go on stage with pre-recorded vocals and lip sync.</p><p>"My band has never practiced this, this is not going to go well," she recalled thinking of this new plan. "I can't do this." But she did. And it did not.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e7/4by3/2024/02/20/e7213a8524d84a88a54d98ebad3da7d6_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Getty/NBC</span><p>Simpson was slated to sing two songs; the first, "Pieces of Me," went off without a hitch. As she and her band were preparing for second song "Autobiography," the "Pieces of Me" intro began to play instead -- and so did her vocals before she had the microphone to her mouth.</p><p>After escaping the moment with an awkward jig, Simpson returned at the end of the show with an excuse. "My band started playing the wrong song, and I didn't know what to do, so I thought I'd do a hoedown," Simpson said. "I'm sorry. This is live TV. These things happen!"</p><p>Critics and fans were quick to point out the singer had clearly been lip-syncing for the show, and the moment quickly went viral (such as it was in those days) and became fodder for late-night jokes and parody.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:449e42e3-fa65-4377-ae41-b85a1a01b86d data-container-ref=toofab:article:1b85977b-c692-4f6c-aae0-64282ca4d3f5 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=30><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0e/5by4/2021/11/17/0edd7f9e32b941d7aafca02544051c09_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>Ashlee Simpson, JoJo and Addison Rae Among Top Ten Female Singers of All Time, According to This List</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Looking back 20 years on, Simpson said the whole experience taught her "the power of my no". She added, "If I would've had that power to really have been like -- which I would have now, or looking back -- I'd be like, 'I won't be showing up. Period.'"</p><p>"I feel like it was a humbling moment for me," she said. "I had the number one song. It was, like, everything was about go, like, somewhere and then it was just, like, woah! The humility of not even understanding what grown a-s people would say about you, awful, awful things."</p><p>"I think having to find at a young age that strength to be like, 'I am good at this and I will keep going, and I will keep fighting,'" Simpson said, adding that she felt like she learned "how to get back up and go again."</p><p>The younger sister of singer <a href=#><strong>Jessica Simpson</strong></a> was ultimately asked back to the live show a year later. However, she said she is unable to find footage of that live performance online.</p><p>"'I went back to SNL with my second album and I can't find it anywhere. I've searched and searched for that performance," she said. "I was really nervous when I was on there and I can’t find it anywhere."</p><a id=gallery-link-839475f5-0a6f-4acf-bc3b-e2beaa94191c class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:839475f5-0a6f-4acf-bc3b-e2beaa94191c data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:1b85977b-c692-4f6c-aae0-64282ca4d3f5 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/37/4by3/2024/02/20/379cb593422f4ef29f40508ac1db5229_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2tma2hflsCpuMSeZKyhnaXAsLqMq5yvoaOewbR50qejZqSZpXq0xc2cZJ2dkpawrbGMa2dmsZWWv7R5y5qrnqpf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fire-hockey-teams-play-to-help-families-of-fallen-firefighters.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fire hockey teams play to help families of fallen firefighters</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bazaar-nice-saves-april-17-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>19 Must-Have Items on Sale This Week</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
