As the name suggests, this involves rolling the battery components into a cylindrical formation. While this method has sufficed for many years, stacked batteries can offer an even higher charge capacity.</p><p>So, how is this achieved?</p><p>By stacking the anode and cathode layers on top of each other, the electrodes within the battery are folded to form a Z-shaped formation. This process is known as lamination. This folded structure means stacked batteries can comprise a greater battery density, higher battery capacity, and a longer-lasting single charge.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What's more, stacked batteries can save space, a limited resource in today's lightweight smartphones.</p><p>Stacked batteries are commonly seen in modern electric vehicle models. Though those used in smartphones will look different, the same general structure and idea will be followed.</p><h2 id=how-stacked-batteries-will-improve-smartphones>How Stacked Batteries Will Improve Smartphones</h2><p>Given how much we currently use our phones, a battery that can provide a longer single charge is long overdue. With all the software running on our smartphones, it's natural for the <a href=#>battery to drain fairly quickly</a>, but some devices can't even go a day without going completely flat.</p><p>Increasing a smartphone's battery capacity is already possible, but this would take up more space and add extra weight to the phone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is where stacked batteries can help, as their increased density can allow a longer single charge without packing on more weight. This may extend your phone's battery life by multiple hours.</p><p>This will be a game changer in the smartphone industry, as demand for greater capacity batteries is already high.</p><p>What's more, stacked smartphone batteries may make modern smartphones safer and more sustainable. Stacked batteries are more adaptable and can be modified easily if problems occur.</p><p>Additionally, placing insulation layers within the stacked battery electrode layers can isolate issues to a single cell instead of affecting the battery. Though this will still reduce the battery capacity, it can avoid a total shutdown.</p><h2 id=the-downside-of-stacked-smartphone-batteries>The Downside of Stacked Smartphone Batteries</h2><p>Despite all their perks, heat is a key downside that can affect stacked smartphone batteries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because stacked batteries have a higher density, heat generation and heat release are greater. This could lead to reduced performance and overheating. Smartphone companies may develop a solution to heat release, but this is yet to be seen.</p><h2 id=are-stacked-batteries-available-right-now>Are Stacked Batteries Available Right Now?</h2><p>Currently, there aren't any smartphones on the market using stacked batteries. But the release of the Apple iPhone 15 could change this norm.</p><p>We know how common smartphone myths are, and a good deal of them turn out to be untrue. There are <a href=#>a few things we know about the iPhone 15</a>, but unsubstantiated rumors circulate.</p><p>While nothing has been confirmed at the time of writing, it is rumored that the iPhone 15 will use stacked batteries to prolong the life of a single charge.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Independent</a>, anonymous Twitter user @RGcloudS leaked that Apple is working on a new kind of battery for its next flagship iPhone release. @RGcloudS is known in the Android rumor space, though this alleged leak brought iPhone into the mix.</p><p>The tweet has since sparked the interest of news outlets worldwide, with tech enthusiasts eager to find out whether what's claimed is true.</p><p>Along with other interesting details, it is stated in the tweet that Apple will be using stacked batteries in the entirety of its next flagship phone series.</p><p>This is yet to be confirmed by Apple itself but has certainly sparked further excitement around the iPhone 15, which is set to be released in September 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a comment below their tweet, the anonymous individual mentioned that the greater density of the stacked battery would result in less heat dissipation. This may help in avoiding overheating or even conserving energy.</p><p>The user also stated in their original tweet that the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra will likely adopt stacked battery technology, too. @RGcloudS claimed that the S24+ and 24 Ultra batteries have been rated at 5,000 mAh, which is certainly impressive if true. However, it isn't known if the S24+ will use a stacked structure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though the author wrote that the Galaxy 24 Ultra has a different stacked structure, it was alleged that it will achieve 65W charging. To put this into perspective, the <a href=#>Galaxy S23 Ultra</a>, the S24's future predecessor, supports a maximum of 45W. If feasible, this is a huge leap.</p><p>The next Samsung smartphone set to hit the market is the Galaxy 24. It has been rumored that this phone will be released in early 2024, though nothing is known for sure yet.</p><p>If these rumors are true, the two leading smartphone manufacturers are looking to make the stacked battery switch, which is a big step in smartphone advancement.</p><h2 id=stacked-batteries-could-be-revolutionary>Stacked Batteries Could Be Revolutionary</h2><p>While stacked smartphone batteries still exist in the realm of rumors, we may see this technology hit the mainstream in the very near future, be it through Apple, Samsung, or another innovative smartphone manufacturer. Who knows, charging our phone may one day be a weekly ritual rather than daily.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecBmqq2Zk6CypXnSppirrKCdvK%2BxjJuYrayVp8Zw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./652955aa46163f42248b458c-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bigfoot Sighting: What are the most famous Bigfoot sightings in the US?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./vince-neil-chris-janson-more-to-perform-at-big-machine-music-city-grand-prix.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lineup Announced for Big Machine Music City Grand Prix</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
