He then went on to work as an executive at RCA during the early 1970s, but in the year 1974, he went on to sign with Melodyland&nbsp; Records.</p><p>It was a short-lived country label. It was during this time he began using the stage name ‘T.G. Sheppard’ so that he could avoid jeopardizing his job with RCA, due to his recording material with a different label.</p><p>Likewise, he was able to record the song “Devil in the Bottle”, which then became a No. 1 hit on Billboard’s Hot Country Singles chart. It also was able to become a top 60 Pop hit in the year 1975.</p><p>After that, his follow-up, “Tryin’ to Beat the Morning Home”, also went to No. 1 and cracked the top 100 during the summer of that same year. And, several subsequent releases during 1975–77 made the top 10 like “Motels and Memories” and “Show Me a Man”.</p><p>Sheppard then went on to sign with Warner Bros Records in the year 1977. He started with that summer’s “When Can We Do This Again” and then released Last Cheater’s Waltz, I’ll Be Coming Back for More, Do You Wanna Go to Heaven, I Loved ‘Em Every One, Party Time, Only One You, Finally, War Is Hell (On the Homefront Too), Slow Burn, I Loved ‘Em Every One, and many others. Then, in the year, he signed with Columbia Records.</p><p>He then was able to return to the top 10, with his biggest success during this time frame coming with 1986’s “Strong Heart”. Three more of his songs peaked at No. 2 in 1987 and they are Half Past Forever (Till I’m Blue in the Heart), You’re My First Lady, and One for the Money.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-390435 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/T.-G.-Sheppard-Sing-1.jpg alt="T.
