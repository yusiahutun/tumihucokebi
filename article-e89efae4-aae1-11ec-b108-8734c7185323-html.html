Evans swam out to get it but went under and didn’t resurface. That account of what occurred caused some officials to speculate that since the water was much colder than the spring-like temperatures of the day made it appear, his body could have “locked up” because of the shock of the abrupt temperature change.</p><p>Evans was remembered as a humble and gentle man who loved to fish. In the 1980s, he and other residents formed a fishing club that traveled throughout the region. Many people said fishing was Evans’ only vice.</p><p>He served as a middle school and high school coach at various locations.&nbsp;</p><p>“I do appreciate Sheriff Joe Berlin and his dive team for their assistance,” Ashley said.&nbsp;</p><p>Berlin and Chief Deputy Mitch Sumrall responded along with JCSD dive team members Capt. Scott Sims, Seth Bigler, Brooks and Driskell.</p><p>Responding agencies included the Wayne County Sheriff's Department, Wayne County Emergency Management Agency, the Wayne County Volunteer Fire Department, Waynesboro Fire Department, Wayne General Hospital, Wayne County Patrol, Jones County EMA, Jones County Sheriff's Department and Dive Team and the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. At the time the body was recovered, members of the Lamar County Dive Team and Forrest County Dive Team were both en route to the scene.</p><p>“Everyone came together and did what needed to be done,” Lance Chancellor of the JCSD said.</p><p>Evans leaves behind his wife of 40 years Vanette, son John Evans of Clara, daughter Tara Smith of Hattiesburg and sister Rachel Stanley, a longtime official with the Jones County Circuit Court who is now retired.&nbsp;</p><p>His funeral is set for 11 a.m. Friday at West Shady Grove Baptist Church. Visitation is this evening (Thursday) 5-9 p.m. at the church.</p><p>— Paul Keane of&nbsp;</p><p>The Wayne County News contributed</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcK7EpaavnZRisLCtwqFknaqfrLu0ecinZJudkal6p7vUq2SlmZuafKK%2B06KapZ2PmoV6scWanG1lkZaycnmQapycZZJmfXl5l3BqbZtnZoV2f5FsZaGsnaE%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cameron-hanes-wiki-wife-family-job-net-worth-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cameron Hanes Wiki, Wife, Family, Job, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./monica-roccaforte.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Monica Roccaforte dating?
