talking on the topic of Eden.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The man told them the teenager did not take her own life but that she had been to a party, been given an overdose, and the way her body was

students and teachers.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But she noted her school internet search history showed, perhaps not uncommonly for a teenager, searches on topics such as unprotected sex, depression and drugs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She deemed Eden had been depressed, had previously attempted to harm herself, and had written a note six months earlier indicating an 'intent to end her life'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Eden's family have always strongly denied these claims about the adventurous, athletic and funny teen.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Tasmania Police has
