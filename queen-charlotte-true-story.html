Over six episodes, Queen Charlotte – Bridgerton’s only character to be based on a historical figure – is brought to emotive, bingeable life. Though the creators of the show announce lovingly that this is “fiction inspired by fact” and that “all liberties taken by the author are quite intentional”, how close is the story to the reality? Who was the real Queen Charlotte?</p><img alt="queen charlotte bridgerton" title="Queen Charlotte Bridgerton" width=3200 height=2400 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/queen-charlotte-645ba8c47baf2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>She arrived as a German princess who spoke no English</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong></strong>Contrary to the verbose portrayal of Charlotte in Bridgerton’s prequel, Princess Sophia Charlotte of Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz actually spoke no English at all when she arrived. During her wedding day, which occurred just hours after she first stepped foot on English soil, she would have understood almost nothing. A princess from a minor German Duchy, both her parents had died before she came to England. She was relatively uneducated and had no interest in politics – though, as a young girl, she would have seen her mother rule as regent of two German Duchies until Charlotte’s brother came of age. Charlotte was just 17 when she left home.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for One on One with Golda Rosheuvel and India Amarteifio" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screenshot-2023-05-12-at-12-28-02-645e23961ce56.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Charlotte's husband, King George III, was 22 when he came to the throne on the death of his grandfather, George II (as his father had predeceased him).

As a result, the King’s mother and Queen Charlotte were not the best of friends. Indeed, Augusta famously made Charlotte’s earliest days at court incredibly difficult by restricting her movements and insisting on choosing her ladies in waiting.

However, it was not ready in time and would not be used until 1831, and the crowning of William IV. George and Charlotte were instead carried to their coronation on sedan chairs in a procession that took so long they were not crowned until six hours after they departed. Throughout the day, crowns were dropped, jewels fell out of coronets and there were not enough seats – even, initially, for the two monarchs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite a rocky start, and his eventual illness, King George III would go on to become our longest-serving male monarch, and Queen Charlotte our longest-serving Queen Consort – a role she embodied for 57 years until her death, just a few months before the King himself. Their reign was marked by highs and lows – the unification of Great Britain, the loss of America in the war of independence and the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a39523082/prince-william-slavery-speech/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="abolition of slavery" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">abolition of slavery</a> in the British Empire.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While the King was, as in Queen Charlotte, known as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.royal.uk/ten-things-you-didnt-know-about-george-iii#:~:text=During%20his%20reign%2C%20George%20III,part%20as%20a%20playful%20pun." data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="‘Farmer George’" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">‘Farmer George’</a> for his interest in agriculture and his humility, Charlotte herself was a huge patron of the arts (she did have a young <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://mmc.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/entities/person/charlotte-mecklenburg-strelitz/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Mozart class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Mozart</a> play at court and, in fact, he accompanied the Queen as she sang an aria) and a keen botanist, who greatly expanded Kew Gardens.

The King, contrary to precedent, never took a mistress and the royal couple were reported to be extremely content together, until his illness separated them. Though she was initially kept in the dark about his condition, and was reportedly terrified when she discovered it, Charlotte insisted on living with the King at Kew and resisted all attempts to have the monarch declared "insane" – even falling out with her eldest son in the process.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As her husband’s illness worsened, Queen Charlotte was forced to spend less time with him, as his behaviour often became violent and upsetting. The toll the separation took on the Queen was immense; and she was described as having sunk into a great depression and became increasingly reclusive herself. Sadly, when Charlotte died, aged 74, with her eldest son by her side, the King was far too ill to even know or understand what had happened. He would die himself, just 14 months later.</p><img alt="bridgerton golda rosheuvel as queen charlotte in episode 108 of bridgerton cr liam danielnetflix © 2020" title=" " width=2000 height=1336 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bridgerton-108-unit-02383r-1609885622.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Liam Daniel/Netflix</span></p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>There really was a succession crisis</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">George and Charlotte had 15 children together, 13 of whom survived to adulthood, yet Queen Charlotte sees the female monarch obsess over her lack of viable grandchildren (and therefore heirs). This was in fact a reality. Many of her daughters did not marry, and none of her children produced legitimate heirs except her eldest son George, whose daughter –Princess Charlotte of Wales, died in childbirth, as shown in the miniseries. This caused a succession crisis that was indeed solved by the pregnancy of her son Edward’s wife, Victoria.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When Golda Rosheuvel’s Charlotte comments in response to the statement that “a strong queen is just what this country needs” she is making a fourth-wall-breaking nod to the identity of the unborn baby: <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a26818979/jenna-coleman-queen-victoria-replacement/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Queen Victoria" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Queen Victoria</a>, who would ascend to the throne upon the death of her uncle, William IV, in 1837.</p><img alt="queen charlotte bridgerton" title="queen charlotte bridgerton" width=1075 height=713 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/queen-charlotte-644a97f913837.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>She may have genuinely been a biracial woman</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though the “colour-blind” casting of Bridgerton has provoked some controversy, there is a lot of factual evidence for the idea that Queen Charlotte was in fact a biracial woman.
