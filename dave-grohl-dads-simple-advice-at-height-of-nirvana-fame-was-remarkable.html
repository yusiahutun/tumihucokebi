When the band broke up, he became the drummer for Nirvana, before forming the band, Foo Fighters.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1732883780-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dave-grohl-says-his-dad-s-advice-sticks-with-him-to-this-day>Dave Grohl says his dad’s advice sticks with him to this day</h2><p>Although Grohl and his father had an ‘estranged’ relationship at points, he once revealed a piece of advice he gave him at the height of Nirvana’s fame, which has stuck with him throughout his career.</p><p>“Believe me, my Dad, he was a badass, and a super smart dude, and a wicked musician with perfect pitch,” he said in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a> with AD on the Radio.</p><p>He revealed that his father didn’t take “any of this lightly,” and he grew up with a famous drummer in Herb Alpert’s Tijuana Brass. However, when his friend passed away, he didn’t really have much left, as he spent all his money.</p><p>“So when Nirvana became popular my Dad was like, ‘Dude, look, listen. This is what happened to my friend, you know this ain’t going to last, you better treat every single check like it’s your last one, and don’t mess around,'” he revealed.</p><p>Dave then explained to this day, he still feels that way. I feel like, okay, well this is going to be the last record, this is going to be the last record.”</p><p>The rockstar’s father, James Grohl, passed away in August 2014, just a few days after the birth of Dave’s youngest daughter, Ophelia Saint Grohl.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-s-father-didn-t-approve-of-him-being-in-a-rock-band>The star’s father ‘didn’t approve’ of him being in a rock band</h2><p>In his memoir, the Foo Fighters frontman revealed that his father ‘didn’t approve’ of him being in a rock band.</p><p>“My mother was always very supportive and encouraged me to follow my own path,” he wrote. “My father was a conservative Republican speechwriter so I don’t know that he understood a child like mine’s mind.”</p><p>He explained that he thought his father imagined he would take the “conventional route through life,” although the rockstar ‘never considered it’.</p><p>However, the 55-year-old said his father was ‘relieved’ when Nirvana found commercial success, and now as a father himself, understands the concerns.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aBcLDAr5xmn6Kkta15w5qbrGWjnrqxuMRmmJ2umZiybq3TZp%2BeoZedwW67xWaloqqmlruiecWapJ5lp5bAbr7Eppiro5GXuaZ7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./harris-mann-obituary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Harris Mann obituary | Automotive industry</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bgt-epic-transformations-hair-transplant-27130864.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>BGT epic transformations - hair transplant, child star makeover and huge weight loss</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
