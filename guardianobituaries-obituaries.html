The Bahamas-born Calvin Lockhart, who has died following complications from a stroke aged 72, was no exception. The handsome, charismatic Lockhart, who had classical acting training and who spoke French, German, Italian and Spanish, was mainly forced to take roles that he disliked.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>At the start of the 1970s, more than two decades after the birth of the modern civil rights movement, America's 20 million black citizens wanted a more positive media image of themselves. In the meantime, they had to settle for broad comedies and slick thrillers, labelled "blaxploitation". These films became more formulaic as the 1970s progressed - most of them were either "private detective takes on the mob" or "dealer becomes king of the pimps".</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>According to Lockhart's widow, New York interior designer Jennifer Miles-Lockhart, her husband felt that he did not get enough dramatic roles with "meaning, content, which would make a statement. Calvin felt that he wanted to be somewhere where skin colour didn't matter, where he could do his craft freely, on a high level."</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Nevertheless, whatever the quality of the blaxploitation movies, they were directed by black directors and starred black actors, playing characters not seen from a white perspective. Lockhart appeared in one of the first black - as distinct from noir - thrillers, Cotton Comes to Harlem (1970), directed by Ossie Davis. He was the swindler-cum-preacher Reverend Deke O'Malley, who has conned $87,000 from the "good folks" for his phony Back to Africa movement.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Lockhart played suave gangsters called Silky Slim and Biggie Smalls respectively in Sidney Poitier's Uptown Saturday Night (1974) and Let's Do It Again (1975). At least, Melinda (1972), directed by Hugh Robertson, the first African-American editor to be nominated for an Oscar, gave Lockhart the chance to play a super-hero, an egotistic disc jockey who has to take on the mobsters who had murdered his girlfriend.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>In the same year, Lockhart was invited to join the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford-upon-Avon, where he appeared in several plays, notably Buzz Goodbody's production of Titus Andronicus in which, as Aaron the Moor, he asks "is black so base a hue?" and launches into a defence of his colour.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Lockhart had already spent almost five years in England (1965-1970), where he had appeared in TV dramas, such as the Wednesday Play and five British films in 1968: A Dandy in Aspic, The Mercenaries, Only When I Larf, Nobody Runs Forever and Joanna. In the last, directed by Mike Sarne, which also featured Donald Sutherland as a dying English aristocrat, Lockhart, as a nightclub owner was one of the first actors to dent a cinematic taboo with a black-white love scene with the heroine, Genevieve Waite.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Sarne then cast him as the effete Irving Amadeus in the disastrous Myra Breckinridge (1970), and he played a pimp in John Boorman's Leo the Last (1970), before returning to the US to star in Halls of Anger, (also 1970). The setting of this was an all-black blackboard jungle which, because of the national integration plan, has to accept 60 white students who suffer the kind of racism that usually affects black people. However, Lockhart, cast as a teacher, solves all the school's problems by his liberal approach. Despite the theme he disliked making the film and walked off the set more than once.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Lockhart, born Bert Cooper, the youngest of eight children, had left the Bahamas aged 19 to study engineering at New York, but became involved in a YMCA theatre group, and studied with the legendary drama coach Uta Hagen. He made his Broadway debut, taking over from Billy Dee Williams, in Shelagh Delaney's A Taste of Honey, in the role of the sailor who gets the white girl (Joan Plowright) pregnant. He returned to the stage only rarely between Broadway and his stint with the RSC.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>During his second stay in England, Lockhart was given one of his best film roles in The Beast Must Die (1974) as the millionaire owner of a country estate where he has gathered a number of people, one of whom he hopes to reveal as a werewolf. It was enjoyable, camp nonsense, but it did feature a rich, successful black man, whose colour is never mentioned, a rare phenomenon in films of the early 1970s. Another potentially interesting part was in The Baron (1977), where Lockhart played a struggling African-American film-maker who turns to the underworld to raise money. However, the film descended into many of the cliches of blaxploitation gangster movies.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>A couple of years later, Lockhart suffered a heart attack brought on by the news that his son from a former marriage (he was married four times) had lost the use of his legs from jumping under a train. But he returned to work, albeit in a minor capacity. He was in seven episodes as Jonathan Lake in TV's Dynasty (1985-86), was the head of a Jamaican voodoo-gang in Predator 2 (1990), and had small roles in David Lynch's Wild at Heart (1990) and Twin Peaks (1992).</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>In 1979, Calvin met Jennifer Miles in New York, and they had a son in 1981. They married in 2006: she survives him, as do his other two sons and a daughter.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><b class=dcr-epamsi>·</b> Calvin Lockhart (Bert Cooper), actor, born September 18 1934; died March 29 2007</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaKaVrMBwfo9pbmiZoKd8c3%2BOoKyaqpSerq%2B7waKrrpminrK0es6boK2tkae2pr8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cosmetica-ingredientes-azeloglicina-que-es-beneficios-cuidado-piel-manual-uso.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>qu es, cmo se usa y qu beneficios tiene en la piel</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kidz-bop-kids-announces-20-additional-dates-for-kidz-bop-2019-world-tour.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>KIDZ BOP Kids Announces 20 Additional Dates For KIDZ BOP 2019 World Tour</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
