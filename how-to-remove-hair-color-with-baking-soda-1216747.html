But now you feel that it does not suit you. You may have tried coloring your hair on your own and the result is underwhelming. If you’re in a pickle, running out of time, or simply want to try a less abrasive way for removing hair color, here are some tips on how to remove hair color with baking soda. It can help hair color mishaps fade away gradually and naturally. But that baking soda isn’t a magical elixir and it only helps fade the color away and that it may take several tries for the color to completely go away. But, that’s not the only thing to keep in mind when using baking soda to remove hair dye. We’ll be looking at a few methods and helpful step-by-step application tips to get it done the right way.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=657be2143e35e><strong>6 Tried and Tested Ways to Use </strong><strong>Baking Soda for Hair Dye Removal&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Who would’ve thought that an ingredient used in cooking and baking would become a viable and easy solution for removing hair color? Using baking soda for hair lightening is an at-home process trusted by many. Here are some of the most effective methods to do it.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=657be2143e369><strong>Method 1: Baking soda only</strong></h3><p><img alt="Method 1: Baking soda only" title="Method 1: Baking soda only" width=1000 height=667 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-04/1681471279_shutterstock_1704546763.jpg></p><p>Baking soda for hair dye removal in itself is an excellent solution. Baking soda can remove color from your hair but it will not strip away the chemicals used in permanent dyes.</p><p><strong>Things you’ll need:</strong></p><ul><li>Baking soda&nbsp;</li><li>Water&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>How to:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Prepare a paste by mixing baking soda and water.&nbsp;</li><li>Apply the paste to clean, dry hair and let it sit for an hour.&nbsp;</li><li>Rinse it off and follow it up with a shampoo and conditioner.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Frequency: </strong>Twice a day from the day of coloring your hair. Baking soda alone only works on freshly colored hair. Although you may not see a dramatic difference, it helps wash off a lot of the initial coloring.&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Sharing a word of caution, our contributor Kate Ross, a Hair Specialist, says, “For removing hair dye with baking soda at home, it's important to be cautious. Baking soda can be harsh on hair, so it's crucial to use a deep conditioning treatment afterward. While baking soda can effectively strip away hair dye, it can also strip natural oils, so using it sparingly and with proper aftercare is advised.”</p><h3 id=657be2143e396><strong>Method 2: Baking Soda and Anti-Dandruff Shampoo&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Even if you don’t have a dandruff problem, it’s a good idea to use anti-dandruff shampoo as it is known to contain an ingredient called selenium sulfide which helps fade hair dye away. Ketoconazole, a synthetic azole compound with antifungal properties, is also commonly found in anti-dandruff shampoos to control seborrhoeic dermatitis. However, one must be careful in not over-using it as it may make the scalp and the hair dry (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","How to Remove Hair Color with Baking Soda - 6 Interesting Methods","1216747","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105667/","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/how-to-remove-hair-color-with-baking-soda-1216747","1","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>1</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Things you’ll need:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Water&nbsp;</li><li>Anti-dandruff shampoo&nbsp;</li><li>Baking soda&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>How to:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>In a bowl, prepare a mixture of equal parts anti-dandruff shampoo and baking soda.&nbsp;</li><li>Then start adding a few drops of water and smoothen it into a paste.Ensure that the paste is not gritty.&nbsp;</li><li>Wet your hair thoroughly before applying the paste.&nbsp;</li><li>After you have applied it, keep it for the next five to seven minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Wash off properly, preferably with cold water.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Frequency:</strong> It’s safe to try this hack 4-5 times a week. This method works best if your hair color is already fading away and is in the final stages of returning to its natural color.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 id=657be2143e39a><strong>Method 3: Dish Soap, Shampoo, and Baking Soda</strong></h3><p><img alt="Method 3: Dish Soap, Shampoo, and Baking Soda" title="Method 3: Dish Soap, Shampoo, and Baking Soda" width=1000 height=667 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-04/1681471306_shutterstock_1920572453.jpg></p><p>Yes, another peculiar kitchen item makes it to the list. Why dish soap though? It acts as a mild bleaching agent and helps lighten your tresses. Dish soaps are deliberately made with the intent to break up oil on greasy dishes, leaving it sparkly clean. So, if you’re using it to remove unwanted hair color, use it sparingly as it may cause your hair to dry out.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Things you’ll need:&nbsp;</strong></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><ul><li>Dish soap&nbsp;</li><li>Shampoo&nbsp;</li><li>Baking soda&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>How to:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Mix 5 drops of dish soap, a coin-sized amount of shampoo, and 2 tablespoons of baking soda in a bowl.&nbsp;</li><li>Add a few drops of water to bring it to an almost runny consistency.</li><li>Apply the paste generously throughout your hair and bring it to a soapy lather.&nbsp;</li><li>Wash it off thoroughly and air dry it out immediately. If that is not an option, use a hair dryer.&nbsp;</li><li>Apply a thin layer of oil to protect your hair from becoming too dry.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Frequency:</strong> As dish soaps could potentially ruin your hair and make it dry it is advisable to try this method out only twice a week and never twice in a row on the same day.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=657be2143e3a2><strong>Method 4: Crushed Vitamin C tablets and Baking Soda&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>No, we’re not joking. Yes, you really can use Vitamin C tablets and baking soda to remove hair dye. Why Vitamin C? It’s a safe and non-abrasive way to lighten your hair color, especially if you chose a dark one. The acid in vitamin C oxidizes the dye and makes it loose, so that it doesn’t cling to your hair. A study linked hair loss to a Vitamin C deficiency (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","How to Remove Hair Color with Baking Soda - 6 Interesting Methods","1216747","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6380979/","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/how-to-remove-hair-color-with-baking-soda-1216747","2","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>2</u></a>). As the tablets lighten your hair, it’s also playing a role in protecting your hair. This method works best if you colored your hair less than 3 days ago. If it's been longer, you may not see the same results and the fade may look negligible.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Things you’ll need&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Water&nbsp;</li><li>Baking soda&nbsp;</li><li>Vitamin C tablets or powder&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>How to:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Crush vitamin C tablets to a fine powder and mix it with water. If you can find Vitamin C powder, your job is made easier.&nbsp;</li><li>In a separate bowl, mix some baking soda with water to form a paste.&nbsp;</li><li>Wet your hair and apply the Vitamin C paste all over the hair. Vitamin C can only properly penetrate your hair when it’s wet.&nbsp;</li><li>Cover your hair with a shower cap or wrap your hair with a plastic sheet.</li><li>Let it sit for an hour.&nbsp;</li><li>Rinse the mixture out properly with water only. Rinse as many times as necessary till you feel like there is no residue left.&nbsp;</li><li>Apply baking soda paste and let it sit for 5 minutes.&nbsp;</li><li>Rinse with water and follow it up with a mild shampoo and a conditioner.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Frequency:</strong> Once a week.&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h3 id=657be2143e3a9><strong>Method 5: Hydrogen Peroxide and Baking Soda&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Hydrogen peroxide is a colorless liquid often used as an antiseptic on the skin to prevent infections on burns, cuts, and the like. It’s also used as a bleaching agent for dyed hair and works by toning down hair color. It oxidizes the hair pigment, melanin, and keratin, which is the hair’s structural protein. Using hydrogen peroxide and baking soda to remove hair dye is a winning combination as baking soda delays the process of the paste drying out fast.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Things You’ll Need:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Hydrogen peroxide&nbsp;</li><li>Baking soda&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>How to:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Prepare a thick paste of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda.&nbsp;</li><li>Wash your hair properly with shampoo before applying the paste. Don’t use a conditioner or leave-in serums as the hair needs to be as clean as possible.&nbsp;</li><li>Let it become damp and divide your hair into as many sections as you like for easy application.</li><li>Make sure that you’re not using more than 03% hydrogen peroxide otherwise it may damage your hair.&nbsp;</li><li>Using a flat brush, start applying the paste all over the hair. Ensure that it is kept for at least 30 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Wash it off with cold water only and follow it up with a shampoo and conditioner.&nbsp;</li><li>Let it air dry for best results.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Frequency: </strong>Once a week.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Method 6: Baking Soda and Lemon Juice</strong></h3><p><img alt="Method 6: Baking Soda and Lemon Juice" title="Method 6: Baking Soda and Lemon Juice" width=1000 height=667 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-04/1681471373_shutterstock_797496406.jpg></p><p>&nbsp;Lemon helps in clearing out the toxins from your hair.

We hope that your quest for how to remove hair color with baking soda ends here and the methods mentioned above work flawlessly for you.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s just one request from us. Please be careful. Consult a dermatologist or a hair and scalp expert before trying out any of these methods to ensure safety and good hair health. If you can’t find the time to do that, at least please make the sound choice of conducting a patch test and wait an hour to see if any allergies flare up.
