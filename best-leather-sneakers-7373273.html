The best ones feel super supportive and comfortable to walk in with little breaking in needed. They also visibly wear well over time. Most come in solid white, which adds to the versatility, but you can also find styles to spice things up a bit — such as ones in funky colors or that boast tasteful logos.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-nike-air-force-1-shadow></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nike Air Force 1 Shadow</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nike Air Force 1 Shadow" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5eoakTkTr6dgH8OkfETiByRWOSw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Nike-Air-Force-1-Shadow-c0202fec51844887b0ea88169dbd5235.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They're a great value, considering their price and durability.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The sizing is inconsistent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Oh, how we love Nike these sneakers, which come in a range of colorways. “I could not imagine selecting my top sneaker picks without adding a classic Air Force 1 to the mix — but let’s take it a bit further with the Shadow collection,” says fashion marketing consultant <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Nina Vargas</a>. “Aside from the added detailing on the swoosh, these bad boys give you a little extra height on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>platform</a>.

You're likely going to get a ton of wear out of these shoes and never have to worry about them going out of style. InStyle writer Bianca Kratky can attest to Reebok's superior quality, having walked around the globe in one of their sneakers without them breaking down (they were strong for another six years after). All of that without even a heavy financial investment, now that's a win.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A feature that sets this shoe apart from the rest is the soft interior lining around the ankles. If you look carefully, you'll find a terry lining on the interior. It may feel a little hot in the summer, but for every other season, you'll feel grateful for the additional warmth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–11 |<strong> Colors: </strong>7</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-common-projects-original-achilles-leather-sneakers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge:</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Common Projects Original Achilles Sneakers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Common Projects Original Achilles Leather Sneakers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qW679FAllHhCRBltFw6eRRmA6Yk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/common-projects-original-achilles-leather-sneakers-c1da559d8f9342c2958c3bce76923abf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It's made in Italy using calf leather, which is softer and more flexible than traditional leather.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>There are no half sizes, and shoppers are recommended to size down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">By now you probably recognize the signature serial number look from the Common Projects sneaker. Not unlike a status symbol, the factory ID code lets sneakerheads know that this is the Common Projects shoe — Italy-made, calf leather and all. The logo can be found in the footbed as well, as a bit of a quiet luxury detail. While there isn't much of an arch support, the ankle collar and tongue are padded for comfort. Like most European shoes, however, there are no half sizes available. The brand recommends sizing down if you are in between sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–12 |<strong> Colors: </strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-vegan-pangaia-grape-leather-sneakers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Vegan</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pangaia Grape Leather Sneakers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pangaia Grape Leather Sneakers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jBs315xukLWyoao2_YEaocU7ezU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pangaia-grape-leather-sneakers-c146dd136c274707a04399e8188044c2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Pangaia</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They boast sustainability credentials without compromising on style.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> You may need to size down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These sneakers from sustainable label Pangaia come in solid black or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>white</a>. They feature small logos on each side of the uppers but remain incredibly sleek. Material-wise, they're made from vegan leather that’s not just a fancy way to say plastic: They use discarded grape waste from the wine-making industry to create a lightweight, leather-like material that’s more, well, organic. Ditto for the soles, which are crafted from 86 percent natural rubber, and for the laces, made from cotton and recycled plastic tips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>EU36–EU45 |<strong> Colors: </strong>2</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="A close up of the bottom of the Pangaia Grape Sneakers" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PxytcshBCWCKLVOB1MJrbQ6Ti5g=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-tier-3-detail-pangaia-grape-sneakers-sakura-pink-ahuang-080-c406d3eb378142c087b581e7f139a797.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Alexander Huang</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="The Pangaia Grape Sneakers on the floor" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/oeDo1RSc2gknyDbIpU9n7Y42DaU=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-tier-3-product-pangaia-grape-sneakers-sakura-pink-ahuang-061-f38e129cd9e34611879b6437e8db8a8c.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Alexander Huang</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-white-veja-esplar-sneaker></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best White</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Veja Esplar Sneaker</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Veja Esplar Sneaker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BTUAfF_qDxEX6Q3c5UIoZ6jeF_s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/veja-esplar-sneaker-70b8ad722ed648ab8093a7b16adf096c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Zappos</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re eco-friendly.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The tongue rubs against the skin at first.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Generally, we love French brand Veja all the same for its ideals. The brand employs eco-friendly materials and supports social causes, such as workers' rights. Traceability, too, is of utmost importance to the founders, and it begins with the farm origins of the leather and ends with the tanneries and factories where the shoes are produced. Rubber is sourced from the Amazon and used for the insoles and outsoles, and laces are made with organic cotton. And for $150, doing good doesn't come at a high premium to shoppers looking for a classic white sneaker. They’re perfect for anyone who prefers a discreet (rather than chunky) pair of kicks to wear with jeans and T-shirt dresses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>EU36–EU42 |<strong> Colors:</strong> 4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-black-adidas-samba-og-shoes></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Black</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Adidas Samba</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Adidas Samba OG" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/yIjy6rPAAuBIHb1mtysMgB8uGFE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/adidas-samba-og-274de779fdd34b69b8ecc6bb708127d5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Adidas</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re a favorite among fashion people in the know.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Reviewers say they run large.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“We can’t talk about leather sneakers without talking about the runaway return of the Adidas Samba,” says personal stylist and fashion writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Louise Pennington</a>. “Born in the 1950s as an indoor soccer sneaker, the Samba has become the go-to sneaker for the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>trend </a>set."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are over 20 colorways, many with contrasting stripes for added effect. If you’re in the market for black sneakers, you're in luck, as this style comes in four versions: a full black shoe, plus another three with contrasting details. For those who need more than fashion credentials to sell them on a pair of sneakers, the Sambas are more than just a status symbol — they’re also lightweight and super comfy for going about your daily tasks, and they hold up well over time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–15 |<strong> Colors:</strong> 21</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-retro-inspired-autry-medalist-sneakers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Retro-Inspired</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Autry Medalist Sneakers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Autry Medalist Low-Top Sneakers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8I7riDLuwB20WPEkpP0wOA2GmOA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/autry-medalist-low-top-sneakers-e872c8489be84e8d8439e4036235d967.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Farfetch</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The breathable perforations perfect for everyday, year-round wear.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> We’d love these to come in half-sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Bella Hignett</a>, a London-based stylist, prefers to opt for a vegan sneaker wherever possible, there are a handful of models she’ll make an exception for, including these by Autry. “I love the Autry Medalist Low suede and leather sneakers, which stay close to their ’80s roots,” she says. Comfort-wise, these don’t disappoint either. With a slightly wider fit than average, they don’t take much — or any! — breaking in at all, and you can stand in them all day without wanting to tear them off your feet in a fit of rage. We only wish that half sizes were available for a more exact fit, but frankly, we’re nitpicking.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–12 |<strong> Colors: </strong>3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-comfortable-cariuma-salvas-leather-sneaker></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Comfortable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cariuma Salvas Leather Sneaker</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cariuma Salvas Leather Sneaker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/TQfPe7nDUZhXlo_kXn0UiL8OPg0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cariuma-salvas-leather-sneaker-5cd6731ae33148eeaf44153e5b3f75ff.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cariuma</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Buying one pair funds the planting of two trees in Brazil through a rainforest restoration program.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They lose their shape quicker than some sneakers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like Veja, Cariuma specializes in sneakers. That means the creators are focused on perfecting their product, and we think they've nailed it. Since the brand was created by two friends with a mutual passion for board sports and preserving the environment, there are two lines to consider: one for skateboarding and another for everyday wear — the latter is where Salvas style lives.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The style is handcrafted using LWG-certified leather. The lining is made from recycled mesh to reduce waste, the removable insole is made from natural materials, and the laces are made from recycled plastics and organic cotton. Thanks to their cushioned heel collar and memory foam, they feel like a hug for your feet from the first wear.

Hignett falls in the latter: “I still love the Adidas Stan Smith Original, 25 years on,” she says. “For me, a sneaker should be classic rather than a pimped-up version covered in logos and plastic.” And with their all-white look with an optional contrasting panel in the back, these sneakers are as classic as they come. A detail that adds to their fashion cachet? “Phoebe Philo brought them back to our attention in 2010 when she was spotted taking a bow on the catwalk after her Celine show,” Hignett says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately for leather purists, these days the Stan Smith style is made from faux leather, a spec that can make its price point of $100 harder to swallow.

In various shades of white, these can pass for a sporty sneaker, but in black or brown, they’re a dressier pick than your average pair. They’re made from luxe-looking LWG Silver-certified Italian leather, which means that it's responsibly tanned using processes that reduce emissions and waste. The shoes are handmade in Italy with hand-painted edges, which is fancy and cool.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Primo also fits beautifully, looks stylish and special, and lasts for ages thanks to the high-quality craftsmanship. The sole lets it down a little since it gets used faster than the rest of the shoe, but most people are willing to look past it. Last but not least, they’re also really comfortable (well, after some breaking-in).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–11 |<strong> Colors:&nbsp;</strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-mid-top-converse-cons-fastbreak-pro-leather></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Mid-Top</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Converse CONS Fastbreak Pro Leather</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Converse CONS Fastbreak Pro Leather" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/M7L87xk_mIMadcw9JsxoMxcEP0U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/converse-cons-fastbreak-pro-leather-ab15af88a26c4fd3bb392c57a862fda1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Converse</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Created with skateboarding in mind, they’re incredibly comfortable for long hours on your feet.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They size a bit large.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Skater girls, listen up. These shoes were designed with your board-riding antics in mind, with a traction outsole and special impact protection. Still, we love these for everyday, too, and those features are just bonuses in terms of comfort, making them an amazing choice for anyone who walks or stands a lot throughout the day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Available in four colorways, we see these mid-tops pairing seamlessly with your collection of mom jeans. We also love that these are only available directly from Converse, making them a more unique pick that you won’t see on everyone else in your hometown. Some people find they size a bit large, but as long as you do your homework before ordering a pair, we don’t see that being too much of a problem. Besides, they’re available in half sizes, making it easier to find an exact fit for your feet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>4.5–14.5 |<strong> Colors:&nbsp;</strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-slip-on-vince-blair-slip-on-sneaker></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Slip-On</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vince Blair Slip On Sneaker</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vince Blair Slip On Sneaker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/O_tsj2T-ycCNY5bcJuSAaynaXVs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vince-blair-slip-on-sneaker-027c038936804990be040d84114845b0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bloomingdale's</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They don’t take any breaking in!</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They don’t last as long as you may want them to.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Your first instinct when shopping for leather sneakers might not be to head straight to Vince, a brand mostly known for its luxe ready-to-wear clothing, but we're here to say that this pair is one to consider. The perforated slip-on is especially easy to style and comes in a range of neutral colors to keep the focus on the rest of your outfit. It's designed with a bumper sole to help absorb some of the shock when your foot hits a hard surface, as well as an elastic inset to make sure it doesn’t slip off at inopportune times.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Some reviewers aren’t super impressed with how long these last, saying that the sole can wear out and the color can fade after a few months of use, but they love how comfy and squishy they feel while walking in them. They also don’t take any breaking in, which is a big win for the leather sneaker contingent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–13 |<strong> Colors: </strong>10</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-suede-vans-sport-low-top-sneaker></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Suede</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vans Sport Low Top Sneaker</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=708 data-sizes=750px alt="Vans Sport Low Top Sneaker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/siZ5MWhEnnL1kwYRvV_Nfuog_Es=/fit-in/1500x708/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/VansSportSuedeSneaker-0c89287adb16485dbf1bf99d11463f7f.png"><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The quality you get for the low cost can't be beat.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The low-top cut doesn't provide a ton of ankle support.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You may know Vans well for its classic canvas styles, but it also makes a great pair of suede sneakers, too. We love the off-white color here, which helps to conceal any dirt or distressing you'd certainly see on a stark white material. Those already familiar with the brand know that you always get a good bang for your buck as the quality of the shoe far exceeds the price tag it comes with. Seriously, leather for less than $80? That's a steal. The low-top cut doesn't provide a ton of ankle support but it does make it more summer friendly. Just be sure to find equally low-cut socks so they don't awkwardly poke out from the top.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–10 |<strong> Colors: </strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-minimalist-axel-arigato-clean-90-sneakers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Minimalist</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Axel Arigato Clean 90 Sneakers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Axel Arigato Clean 90 Sneakers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/shXaD8IkWRSKb8Uee_5LmHAe4js=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/axel-arigato-clean-90-sneakers-e6b6ba3a2cd849e9853434f652f3a37d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shopbop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The leather used here is responsibly sourced.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>There is no arch support.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Swedish label Axel Arigato is a lifestyle brand that feeds into (and thrives off of) artistic streetwear, music culture, and high fashion. You may know them best through some of their chunkier <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">dad-sneaker</a> styles, but this sleek minimalist shoe is just as worthy of praise. The clean canvas is completely white except for the "Arigato" label etched in gold on the side.

And sure, you could say it amassed such fame because of its retro appeal and place in fashion history (it was a popular basketball shoe in the '90s), but it's also because of its ease of wear. The leather upper is well padded, and the soles have a bit of arch support so that your feet don't feel strained after a long day. The generously thick rubber outsole offers even more support. Some shoppers say the style runs large, so you may want to size down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–11 |<strong> Colors: </strong>3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Real or Faux: </strong>“Leather” sneakers come in three styles: real leather, faux leather, and mixed. Real leather looks beautiful, feels soft to the touch, and can be biodegradable if it’s tanned without harmful chemicals (though Hignett notes that this is sadly not the case with the majority of mainstream leather sneakers). It’s also more durable than faux leather. Meanwhile, faux leather can often be a more affordable alternative and it might be your preference if you’re vegan or object to leather production for any reason.</li><li><strong>Slip-On or Laces:</strong> A slip-on sneaker can make a fantastic option for convenience, while a lace-up shoe allows you to get a custom fit and loosen or tighten them as needed. With the ladder option, you can also swap out different laces and change up the style. We find a slip-on style can look more casual, but ultimately, you should choose a style to reflect your lifestyle and sartorial ethos.</li><li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Leather sneakers can be anything from clean-cut office shoes to skater shoes. “Leather sneakers pair sleek, timeless, and hard-wearing fabric with the more undone aesthetic of a casual sports sneaker, creating a versatile balance between the two,” says Pennington. When it comes to styling her clients, the expert likes to follow the “wrong shoe theory,” pairing sporty, cool-girl leather sneakers with a tailored pantsuit or floaty silk skirt. While they go with just about anything, Hignett still cautions against wearing a sneaker to professional events, such as interviews, or formal events, like a fundraising gala. "[Though,] I have seen a bridegroom or two walk up the aisle in elegant white pairs,” she says. “The jury is out on that one!”</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you clean leather sneakers?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you like your leather sneakers squeaky clean, you’ll need a certain amount of upkeep. “Brands usually sell leather cleaning products with their product,” says stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Jeffrey Ampratwum</a>, who teaches Menswear at the Fashion Institute of Technology. “If you must clean leather sneakers on your own: A lint-free cloth with just a dab of warm water is enough to prep the sneaker for a polish.

If comfort is your main concern, opt for shoes that are designed with features such as a thicker outsole, a foam insole, or cushioned parts to avoid rubbing.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do leather sneakers stretch?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Leather sneakers are soft and flexible, and will stretch to a certain degree.
