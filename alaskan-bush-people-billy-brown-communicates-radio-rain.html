Some of these signs are so blatantly obvious and theses signs happen to all of us almost every day,” Rain told the publication.</p><p>“It makes me feel better knowing that he is always with me. It is very comforting," she added.</p><p>The youngest Brown sibling explained the "signs" she gets from her dad who died in February after suffering a seizure in the family's Washington home.</p><p>“He comes through on the radio," she recalled. "It’s so strange because, even on the stations that don’t usually play this kind of music, I will turn on that station, or be flipping through the channels, you hear Stevie Ray on a station that does not play that kind of music."</p><p>She continued: "Or a song that will describe what is happening in my life. It will come on at the exact moment I am thinking about it or thinking about him. It is too strange to be coincidence."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>The matriarch's <a href=#>final moments and funeral arrangements</a> appeared on the Discover show in a recent episode.</p><p>Billy's son, Bear, 34, <a href=#>explained to HollywoodLife</a> why the family chose to air such intimate moments saying: “Dad loved the show and he loved the people so much!</p><p>“We think that the fans and everyone that loves the show deserves to see everything and to&nbsp;see his funeral and all.</p><p>“We discussed whether or not to include it and we felt like we should include it for sure because we believe that is what Dad would want.”</p><p>Bear also explained how he is doing in the death's aftermath: “I am doing alright. You think that you understand loss.</p><p>"I am just trying to keep one foot in front of the other.”</p><p>Reflecting on his father’s passing, <a href=#>Bear</a> said: “That was the hardest episode I have ever filmed.</p><p>“I broke down several times during the filming of this.</p><p>“My dad meant so much to me.</p><p>“I should have seen it coming because he had failing health for a while.</p><p>“It just seemed really sudden and out of the blue.”</p><h2><strong>TRAGIC PASSING</strong></h2><p>On the October 31st episode, Billy's daughter Snowbird, 26, <a href=#>got emotional</a> about the moment she realized she was going to lose her father.</p><p>Snowbird recalled being told by emergency services that they couldn't put Billy in the helicopter because his heart was too weak.</p><p>She teared up as she remembered the family were told to say their goodbyes when Billy was still alive.</p><p>"The helicopter came and they assessed it and he was too bad to take him in the helicopter.</p><p>"They couldn’t continue CPR on him or take him anywhere because his heart wouldn’t beat on its own.</p><p>"So they told us while he was still alive that we should say our goodbyes."</p><p>Later on Snowbird confided: "I know dad would want for us not to be sad, and to go on. But honestly going forward seems impossible because every day seems like a nightmare that I cant wake up from. Or hell."</p><p>The latest episode covered the events of that day and the void that Billy left behind as his wife and kids struggled to come to terms with his loss.</p><p>Billy also shared kids Matthew, 38,&nbsp;<a href=#>Joshua "Bam Bam" Brown</a>, 37,&nbsp;<a href=#>Gabe,</a>&nbsp;31, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Noah</a>, 28, with wife&nbsp;<a href=#>Ami</a>, 58.</p><h2><strong>DEVASTATING LOSS</strong></h2><p>In a series of 911 calls exclusively obtained by The Sun,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alaskan Bush People</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">crew members were on the scene when the seizure occurred.</a></p><p>Footage from the&nbsp;<a href=#>incident features members of the family shouting: "Wake up dad!</a>"</p><p>As The Sun previously reported, CPR was performed unsuccessfully.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The TV star had been in and out of the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hospital in recent years</a>&nbsp;and was previously told by medical professionals that the high altitude wasn't good for him.</p><p>The father-of-seven decided to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">defy doctor's orders</a>&nbsp;and continue to live in the mountains with his family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000677610106.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000597877036-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000596077265.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Alaskan Bush People’s Snowbird breaks down as she recalls moment she was told to say goodbye to dying dad Billy Brown</span><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsYWWAdnyYaJilmaOgrq95wa6qoWWgmryxuMRmmaKknK56o77OsKVmm5%2Biura6yJyYrZ2jYr%2BisMioZKuZmaN8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hugh-jackman-teases-big-comeback-fans-divided-appearance-see-why.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hugh Jackman teases big comeback but divides fans with appearance see why</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./airline-meals-eight-best-and-three-worst-according-very.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Airline meals: eight of the best and three of the worst, according to a very frequent flyer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
