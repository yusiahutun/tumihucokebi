The actor had roles in the early 2000s including those on NBC’s Heroes and ABC’s Nashville. He transitioned into voice roles while he voiced Periwinkle in Blue’s Clues in 2004 and the Shovelmouth Boy in Ice Age: The Meltdown. He also starred in The Walking Dead and has four posthumous acting releases including Aah! Roach.&nbsp;In 2019, Jansen announced that he had become a painter, but he was “painting for most of” his life.

Read more below.</p><h2>How did Jansen Panettiere die?</h2><p>How did Jansen Panettiere die? According to the statement from his family on February 27, 2023, the actor and artist died from “cardiomegaly (enlarged heart), coupled with aortic valve complications.”</p><p>“Jansen’s heart could be seen in his eyes, and his charm in his brilliant, engaging smile; his soul in his masterful and revealing paintings, and the joy of life in his dry wit,” his mother Lesley Vogel, father Skip Panettiere and sister, “Scream VI” star Hayden Panettiere, said in a statement to<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> ABC News. </a>“His charisma, warmth, compassion for others, and his creative spirit will live forever in our hearts and in the hearts of all whom he encountered.”</p><p>They continued, “Though it offers little solace, the Medical Examiner reported Jansen’s sudden passing was due to cardiomegaly (enlarged heart), coupled with aortic valve complications. We sincerely appreciate the outpouring of love and support towards our family as we navigate this unthinkable loss, and ask that we be gifted our privacy during this time of mourning,” the family said. “We love you so much Jansen and you will be in our hearts forever.”</p><p>In a police report obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> and published on February 21, 2023, there was no foul play involved. The police report details that one of <span>Jansen’s friends informed investigators he was supposed to be at the meeting on Sunday. He didn’t show up and they thought something might be wrong. The friends then went to his apartment and found him sitting upright in a chair, unresponsive, called 911 and started CPR. According to Jansen’s father, he called him the night of his death and said he was “okay.” The toxicology and autopsy report won’t be completed for another few weeks.&nbsp;</span></p><p>According to sources close to <a href=# rel=noopener>Hayden,</a> the Scream actress is mourning her brother’s death. “Hayden is absolutely heartbroken,” a source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a>. “She loved her brother unconditionally and the two shared a special bond.” The source continued, “Jansen suffered from mental health issues and art was his therapy and escape,” the source says. “In the past, Jansen was open to family and friends about his struggles. Hayden was always there for him and constantly tried to help Jansen when she could.”</p><p>Weeks before his death, Jansen posted a photo of his sister cutting his hair. “Not the first haircut she’s tried to give me,” he captioned the post. In his artist’s biography on his website, it described his journey as an artist. “After spending time in LA as an adult he was ridden with terrible anxiety and depression; this period in his life eventually produced a spiritual clarity that drove him to start painting his problems, one by one.”</p><p>Jansen described his transition into art in a series of<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> Medium</a> blog posts in 2019. “I’m a painter now. I’ve painted for most of my life but only as of recent have I self identified with the practice. It’s my therapy,” he wrote. “Those of you whom understand anxiety and depression know that it’s like suffocating. It’s like searching for a breathe of cool air in a steam room. When I’m depressed, I do what most other people do, drugs. Alcohol, pot, kratom, ect. They work most of time. I get really depressed sometimes. The kind of depression that no matter the quantity of whatever chemicals I imbibe will simply never be enough. I paint. I paint my problems. It gives me a sense of ultimate purpose. In a world hypnotized by vanity fueled with comparison, art is my escape. The inner demons call to the angels of our being. Finally all these toxic thoughts and feelings have a stage to play and become something much more than just that weight on my chest, the clenching of my fists, the tightness in my jaw. In the words of Meryl Streep ‘take your broken heart and make art.'”&nbsp;Jansen shared his art on Instagram where he also went under the psydoneum RANE.</p><p>Jansen’s former castmate Alyson Stoner paid tribute to Jansen in an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram post</a> on February 23, 2023.”TW: death // Jansen. I don’t know what happened yet, dear human. I know you sent me your art on Friday and by Monday you were gone. I just want to honor your life. I want to honor your complexity, your immeasurable value, your worthiness,” they wrote. “You/we started so young (you were 10 on Holly Hobbie??). I hate the pain that Hollywood added to your/our paths. I’m grateful you reclaimed art as such a visceral and expressive outlet. (It’s been quietly inspiring me in my own journey.) I hope it provided more than a few soothing hours in the pitch black nights. Love you. I hope you are at peace. // Hayden, love you. I’m so sorry for your incomparable loss. Thinking of your family and community. // Keep checkin in on each other. <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=# rel=nofollow>#ripjansenpanettiere”</a></p><p>The Walking Dead producers at Valhalla production <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">posted a tweet</a> in remembrance of the actor. “<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">You might remember Jansen as “Casper” in “The Calm Before” in Season 9 of </span><span class=r-18u37iz>#TheWalkingDead</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">.

I will never forget the first time I saw your face and the first things you said to me. Words cannot express the pain of knowing I won’t hear your laugh again. I hope you find peace, and I’m sorry I wasn’t there when you needed me most. The world is better because you were in it. I know we will paint together again someday. I’ll always be your sugarpop. Someone wake me up and tell me this is a dream. Love you, Bubbles”</p><p><span>If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health crisis, help is available.
