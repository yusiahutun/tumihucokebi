Let's start playing!</p><h2 id=ultimate-guitar-the-largest-song-library-available>1. <a href=#>Ultimate Guitar</a>: The Largest Song Library Available</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ultimate-Guitar.png><p>Ultimate Guitar benefits from a huge community of guitarists who contribute chords and tabs to the website. You will also find several different versions of the songs to practice with too.</p><p>Search for songs using the track name or artist, or click the chord button in search bar to search for particular chords. That way, if you're new to guitar, it's super easy to find songs you can already play by searching the chords you already know.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Users can rate the guitar chords and tabs out of five, making it clear which version is the best. What's more, sign up to Ultimate Guitar Pro to get access to professional guitar chords and lyrics, which are always accurate.</p><p>Ultimate Guitar also features music news, reviews, articles, and interviews. Take a look at the most popular recent guitar chords and tabs or browse through the top 100 tabs of all time to start learning some classics.</p><h3 id=guitar-chords-for-you-and-i-on-ultimate-guitar>Guitar Chords for "You and I" on Ultimate Guitar</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ultimate-Guitar-website-with-You-and-I-Guitar-Chords.jpg><p>Let's walk you through an example of finding guitar chords and lyrics on Ultimate Guitar. Get started by searching for the song you want to learn. In this example, we searched for "You and I" by One Direction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Filter your search results with the <strong>Chords</strong> button, then sort them by <strong>High rated</strong>. If there are several different versions for your song, start with the highest rated one.</p><p>When you click the version you want, you should see a combination of guitar chords, tabs, and lyrics. Sometimes there's also an explanation for how to play the song. In the "You and I" version we chose, there was a link to a performance on YouTube as well.</p><p>Hover your mouse over each chord name to see a diagram showing how to play it. You can hear how it should sound and even use the arrow button to see alternate fingerings. If you want to sing along, transpose the song to a key that's comfortable for you.</p><p>When you're ready to play, click the <strong>Auto-scroll</strong> button at the bottom of the screen.</p><h2 id=chordify-play-along-with-the-recording>2. <a href=#>Chordify</a>: Play Along With the Recording</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Chordify-home-page.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sometimes, you want to learn a particular song even if you don't know how it goes that well. Chordify is perfect for those situations. This website features a super clean interface with large chord diagrams that update as the song plays in real-time.</p><p>Hit the play button and grab your guitar. Chordify loads a YouTube video in the corner and starts playing the actual recording. The display in the center of the screen shows a square box for each bar and tells you when to change to the next chord.</p><p>If anything, it's all a little bit too simple. There's no information about strumming patterns and Chordify doesn't offer alternate chord fingerings, even if the song needs them. There are no lyrics too. But it's a great place to get started.</p><p>Also, if you sign up for a monthly subscription, you can unlock tools to change the tempo, volume, and pitch of the song as you play along with it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=guitar-chords-for-can-t-you-see-on-chordify>Guitar Chords for "Can't You See" on Chordify</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Chordify-page-showing-Cant-You-See-Guitar-Chords.jpg><p>Let's find guitar chords for the song "Can't You See" by the Marshall Tucker Band.</p><p>Search the song or artist you want to play, then click the song from the list of results. There's only one version available for each song, which is nice and simple. But not all songs are "Chordified" which means you might not be able to play along.</p><p>On the next screen, take a look at the chords you need for the song. When you're familiar with them, click the <strong>Play</strong> button and Chordify starts playing the song over YouTube and scrolling through the chords in time.</p><h2 id=songsterr-interactive-tabs-or-clean-chords>3. <a href=#>Songsterr</a>: Interactive Tabs or Clean Chords</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Songsterr-home-page2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are two versions of the Songsterr website. The newer version features an interactive player with tabs for over 500,000 songs.

From here, enter the song title or artist you want to search for, then click the song you want to learn from the results.</p><p>Each song on Songsterr has one of three different icons, to show what's available:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Play</strong> button signifies an interactive tab that uses Flash Player.</li><li>The <strong>T</strong> indicates a tab written out in text form, which is often trickier to read.</li><li>And the <strong>Chord</strong> icon shows songs with the lyrics and chords.</li></ul><p>Click the <strong>Chord</strong> icon to reveal a clean interface with lyrics running down the page and all the chords you need to know on the right.
