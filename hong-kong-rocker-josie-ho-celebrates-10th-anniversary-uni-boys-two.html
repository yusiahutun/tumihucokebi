She released her debut album, Rebellion, in Mandarin in 1994, followed by the 1996 Canto-pop title Ho Ka Suk Nui (“Whose Family’s Lady?/Lady from the Ho Family – the Chinese title has a double meaning), which won her the award for best new artist at the RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Everything seemed to be going well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/03/16/dfbc8946-28f4-11e8-b567-adb1113855b0_1320x770_202111.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I was signed to Capital Artists at the time and they did not expect me to become a pop superstar. They let me be an edgy singer who was different from the mainstream,” she recalls.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But then a new boss came and the team I was working with was fired. I didn’t know what to do. I was a newbie and very timid. I did not dare to speak my mind as I was trying to please the new boss.”</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Seven Chinese hip-hop acts who’ve leapt the Great Firewall to make China look cool</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ho says she got on well with her new boss at first and was confident about her singing career. But then she sang out of tune during a public performance and things started going south.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">My family even told me to leave Hong Kong so that I wouldn’t make them look bad.

Then the management told me that I could not sing live any more. ‘We cannot afford to lose our reputation’, they said.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Ho didn’t give up. Rising singers are often invited to perform at shopping malls and Ho made a counterproposal: “Can I sing live in the New Territories [instead of top-tier shopping malls]?” she asked her boss.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/03/16/515de13e-28c4-11e8-b567-adb1113855b0_972x_202111.jpg>The initial answer was no, but one of her producers secretly helped line up a performance at Sha Tin New Town Plaza. Ho thought this was her chance, but nerves kicked in and she lost confidence. “I had to hide myself behind these huge black sunglasses.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the wake of this second setback, Ho took a long hiatus from singing. “My family even told me to leave Hong Kong so that I wouldn’t make them look bad. They didn’t know how to help me,” Ho says.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">The best Asia spring and summer music festivals – 14 events that you should not miss</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was her friends from the world of rock music who showed her there was hope. She met members of bands such as LMF and actor-producer Conroy Chan, who later became her husband, and they took her under their wing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ho started attending band rehearsals and started learning about rock music. She even started singing backing vocals. She worked with a voice coach, who told her: “That’s your voice. You’d have no luck with Canto-pop.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/03/16/53a04176-28c4-11e8-b567-adb1113855b0_972x_202111.jpg>She formed Josie & The Uni Boys and began singing songs that felt like a true reflection of herself. The five-piece band have released albums including Third Eye (2011), The Electrifying Supernatural Lady Land (2014), and a single, Ho Piu Yi (2017), featuring lyrics by two of Hong Kong’s most prominent lyricists, Wyman Wong and Andrew Lam Man-chung.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Looking back, I should thank the record label boss for telling me the truth.
