The City of Oviedo has failed to reach out to the family to make any effort to address this unfortunate situation. It was not my clients’ preference to initiate litigation, but the city’s failure to investigate this incident and the officers involved left them no alternative," an attorney for the family said, according to WESH.</p><p>The boy's family has not sued the school district.</p><p>While the Oviedo police department said they will not comment on the incident due to the pending litigation.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:97bc993a-8b3e-4b07-9270-844ed119c348 data-container-ref=toofab:article:ab5f3467-4af0-4f8f-8ae5-16d14ccb12ed data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d9/5by4/2022/10/10/d9337e35ae2d4b279d23dcf2d207a107_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Daycare Workers Who Terrified Children with Halloween Masks Punished in Court</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmamhfo7avsYyynJqqXaS5pXnHmqWdm6Wbs6awjJqrZquTnbywuIypmKudnqnAbr%2FUnmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./godfather-of-avocado-toast-bill-granger-dies-after-cancer-battle.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Godfather of avocado toast' Bill Granger dies after cancer battle</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./matthew-kirschenheiter-bio-job-girlfriend-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Matthew Kirschenheiter Bio, Age, Job, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
