The latest revelation that he is a professional dunker intrigued fans who wished to learn more about him.</p><p>Here in this article, we’ll discuss details about his parents, girlfriend, height, and more. So, keep scrolling down and learn more as this article proceeds.</p><h3><strong>Chris Spell On The Bachelorette</strong></h3><p>Although working as a professional dunker may seem odd, Chris Spell, a candidate on The Bachelorette Season 20, actually makes a living doing it. He is one of the 25 men competing for Charity Lawson, the bachelorette for this season.</p><p>Chris might be the lone contender from Season 20 with a world record. He didn’t stop there either; as of 2023, he holds two Guinness World Records for jumping, the most recent of which is for “highest standing backward somersault,” which was accomplished on November 6, 2021.</p><p>For those that are interested, the height of the jump was 1.47 meters. Chris is more than simply a world record jumper, despite what his bio for The Bachelorette might suggest. On one of his Instagram profiles, he presently has over 130,000 followers, which demonstrates his significant social media following.</p><p>Chris shared some interesting details about himself with ABC, joining competitors Dotun Olubeko and Aaron Bryant among others, and let’s just say we now like him even more! The “ride or die” man mentioned that he enjoys binge-watching Grey’s Anatomy, going apple picking in the fall, and drinking wine.</p><p>Despite his love for leaping, Chris acknowledged that sports are only “a part” of who he is on March 12, 2023, when he revealed the motivation behind his personal Instagram account.</p><h3><strong>Chris Spell Girlfriend</strong></h3><p>There is no information regarding Chris Spell’s current relationship status. His socials suggest that he is currently single.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Chris Spell?</strong></h3><p>Born in 1995, Chris Spell is currently&nbsp; 27 years old.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Chris Spell Parents?</strong></h3><p>Chris Spell is the son of Kirk and Nicole Spell. According to Kirk’s Facebook, he and Nicole <a href=#>married</a> on 5 March 2013. However, they are likely separated as Kirk has stated being single on his Facebook.</p><p>Kirk is working as a JV Football Head Coach at Hendrick Hudson High School since August 2012. He is also the owner and operator of <span>Advanced Football Training Camps.</span></p><p>Per Nicole’s LinkedIn, she is working at Crain Communications as Media Services Manager. She also previously worked for Reed Business Information.</p><p>You can find Kirk (<a href=#>@kirk.spell.3</a>) and Nicole (<a href=#>@nicole.spell.77</a>) both on Facebook.</p><p>As for siblings, there are none. He appears to be the only child born to his parents.</p><h3><strong>Chris Spell Height</strong></h3><p>Chris Spell stands tall at the height of 5 feet 11 inches. He weighed 180 lbs per his athlete profile.</p><h3><strong>Chris Spell Job</strong></h3><p>Chris Spell is the owner of Against Odds Athletics Inc. since April 2020. Before that, he worked at Warrior Indoor Baseball & Softball Training as Director of Youth Program.</p><p>Furthermore, he also worked at Against Odds Athletics as a Certified Personal Trainer (2018 to 2020). During the same time period, Chris worked as a head coach at Soccer Shots Franchising.</p><p>Chris attended the University of Buffalo. While there he <a href=#>played football</a>. In 2019, Christopher is a 3x Guinness World Record athlete and a professional dunker. At the time, 63.6 inches stood as the record. Two were measured by Chris; the first was 64.5 inches and the second, was 64.6 inches.</p><p>However, Guinness denied his attempts claiming that the boxes he landed on were too soft. It said he needed to use something more rigid. “I’m going to keep on doing it over and over again until I get this record.” His physical prowess is no coincidence. When Spell was younger, he began playing football. He has intentions to try out for the Canadian Football League and has also played for U.B.</p><p>Chris said he began training to break the record in August 2018. He worked out six days a week with a combination of weight training and jumping. “It’s really all about being consistent, sticking with it, and getting adequate rest, too.”</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Chris Spell Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Chris Spell’s net worth is above $250 thousand.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Chris Spell Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Chris celebrates his birthday on 20 September.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Chris Spell From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Chris hailed from <span class=xt0psk2>Cortlandt Manor, New York.
