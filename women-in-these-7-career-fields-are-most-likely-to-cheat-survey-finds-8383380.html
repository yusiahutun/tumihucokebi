That's quite a range.</p><p>Though it ultimately comes down to the individual, there's still something interesting about seeing <a href=# class=T3D>what those who cheat have in common </a>— and seeing if we can glean some sort of pattern. And <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Ashley Madison</a>, the extramarital dating site, just released data on the career fields of their users. They pulled from information about their users who have joined the site since 2002 to figure out which fields had the most cheaters —&nbsp;and there were definitely some that stood out.</p><p>While the most popular career for men who cheat was working in trade, for women, working in the medical profession was a clear winner. “A combination of long hours of potential stress mixed with a natural reaction to stress just might be the reason these women in the medical profession seek out an affair,” Isabella Mise, Director of Communications at Ashley Madison, said in a press release. “Jobs in teaching, entrepreneurship and finance also all topped the list for female members.”</p><p>But those weren't the only jobs that appeared on the list. Before you look at the rest of the most common professions, don't panic. If you or your partner's career is listed, it doesn't automatically mean that they're going to stray.</p><p>"Just because studies show certain people are more 'wired' to cheat doesn’t mean an individual who shares those traits will decide to do it," <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>certified counselor Jonathan Bennett</a> tells Bustle. "<a href=# class=T3D>Choosing whether or not to cheat</a> involves many factors that go way beyond biology. A few of these factors are moral values, views on fidelity, and even willpower."</p><p>Cheating is really complicated — and working in a certain career fields definitely doesn't mean it's inevitable someone will stray. But seeing the most common career fields are still fascinating to look at. Here's what the Ashley Madison data showed.</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">1</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Medical: 23%</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Andrew Zaeh for Bustle</p></figure><p>The medical field came out as the top spot for women who cheat, with 23 percent of users being in that field.

It may be because<a href=# rel=noreferrer> there are more female teachers</a> in general, but it's still an interesting divide.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">3</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Entrepreneur: 11%</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Andrew Zaeh for Bustle</p></figure><p>Entrepreneurs came in at number three for men and women on Ashley Madison — with 11 percent being self-starters for each gender.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">4</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Finance: 9%</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Andrew Zaeh for Bustle</p></figure><p>Nine percent of the women in the survey worked in finance — as did eight percent of the men —&nbsp;earning it a spot at number four on the list.

OK, maybe not computer geniuses, but better with computers than I am. Or at the very least, probably with fewer cookie crumbs in their keyboards.</p><p>Of course, someone's profession isn't going to be what makes them cheat, but it's still interesting to see how it breaks down. Ultimately, it's down to the individual and the relationship.</p></figure><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC8jrCmpp2eYravedOhnKydXWx6pK3RnpyrZZaesq2w0maYq51dory0wIyloKSdnK56tbuMnJ%2BemaRiwLa%2B1Z6wZp6Zo7G0eZdsb2xraGU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./20-sally-lightfoot-crab-facts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>20 Sally Lightfoot Crab Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./candis-cayne.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Candis Cayne dating?
