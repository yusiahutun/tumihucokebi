If you really want to perfect your makeup application, you have to make sure you're applying it in the right light. "Proper lighting is everything for a flawless look," celebrity makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Janice Kinjo</a> tells InStyle. "With the right lighting, you can even out, blend, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>match foundation to your skin tone</a>." However, with so many options on the market, it can be hard to tell which mirror is worth buying. With that in mind, we set out to find the best lighted makeup mirrors. To do so, we enlisted the help of a handful of reviewers to research the most popular mirrors and test them out firsthand to see which actually live up to the hype.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After thoroughly testing 11 top-rated mirrors — taking into account the mirror's lighting capabilities, clarity, stability and design — we determined the top six lighted makeup mirrors. In the end, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Glamcor Riki Skinny Smart Vanity Mirror with HD LED</a> came out on top thanks to its size and high scores in all of the aforementioned categories.

It's popular among celebrities and makeup artists, and according to the brand, both Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Lopez are fans.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The LED lights have five brightness levels and the mirror itself has a retractable stand and charges via USB. "The lights surround the mirror, which aid in lighting up all areas of your face, making it great for makeup application," our reviewer reveals. "Thanks to the different brightness levels, I would have no issue doing my hair or makeup in a darker room with this mirror."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The lighted makeup mirror also comes with a magnetic magnifying mirror in both 5x and 10x options to really get an up close and personal look at your face. "I'm able to see my pores very clearly, which is useful when blending in foundation or tweezing your brows," our reviewer notes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The best part is, the magnetic phone clip, when attached to the mirror, provides picture-perfect lighting for selfies.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 13" x 9.5" | <strong>Magnification:</strong> 5x or 10x | <strong>Features:</strong> Magnetic phone clip</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="A woman looks into a Riki Loves Riki Skinny Smart Portable LED Vanity Mirror and it shows her upside down reflection" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3R4frU1HZVwaf-2nCt_UOYPZyQA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Web_1500-riki-skinny-smart-vanity-mirror-with-hd-led-tamara-staples-03-3e6a8d029b12457db3912ac6b208030f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Tamara Staples</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2666 data-sizes=750px alt="Staged photo of Riki Skinny Smart Vanity Mirror with serum bottle and cotton rounds next to it" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HfHN7hW8_1tkpzgsCd8mT0CpjNY=/fit-in/1500x2666/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/IS-Riki-Skinny-Smart-Vanity-Mirror-with-HD-LED-tamara-staples-0051-85c6b66c2406413699919918553bc6ae.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Tamara Staples</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-flymiro-tri-fold-lighted-vanity-makeup-mirror></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Value</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Flymiro Tri-Fold Lighted Makeup Mirror</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Flymiro Tri-Fold Lighted Vanity Makeup Mirror" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1k_Mmm9HZ4rrJbXxdZXqEdCqBwg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/flymiro-tri-fold-lighted-vanity-makeup-mirror-1526146d61654a32a7735caf7b1f2dd8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Lighting</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The three-sided mirror offers a view of your face at various angles.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The mirror doesn't offer the option to adjust the brightness</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Flymiro Tri-fold Lighted Vanity Makeup Mirror boasts three magnifications at four different angles. The true 1x mirror sits in the middle and on the left side while a split view 2x and 3x mirrors are on the right side. "The side mirrors magnify close up and provide different views of my face at once," our reviewer says. Plus, the mirror's body can be rotated 180-degrees to help you adjust your vantage point.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The mirror's three panels can be folded closed when not in use, making it ideal for smaller spaces. "I like the fact that the doors shut to avoid damaging or dirtying the glass when [the mirror] is not being used or is being moved to a different location," the reviewer says. She also noted that the mirror is lightweight but stays put when placed on a flat surface.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It's worth sharing that this mirror is available in six colors, such as gold, rose gold, pink, black, green, and white. The sleek, modern design pairs well with any vanity. "I love the design of this mirror — it's aesthetically pleasing and would look nice in any room," she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>9.5" x 7" | <strong>Magnification:</strong> 1x, 2x and 3x | <strong>Features: </strong>180-degree rotation</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-2 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=4480 data-sizes=750px alt="Woman looking at her face in a Flymiro Tri-Fold Lighted Vanity Makeup Mirror" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/VzFY9YyNslgH8MAWOvky6m9Bqso=/fit-in/1500x4480/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/flymiro-tri-fold-lighted-vanity-makeup-mirror-with-3x_2x-magnification-tamara-staples-03.jpg-e057079615634615a0584dfa7808f5d2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Tamara Staples</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4480 data-sizes=750px alt="Woman looking at her face in a Flymiro Tri-Fold Lighted Vanity Makeup Mirror" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/uKIDDqOEJrIZE1__qCb1BsFaZac=/fit-in/1500x4480/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/flymiro-tri-fold-lighted-vanity-makeup-mirror-with-3x_2x-magnification-tamara-staples-02.jpg-3df61d2c6fec4af8be0f2c1407058524.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Tamara Staples</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-high-tech-himirror-mini-premium></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best High-Tech</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>HiMirror Mini Premium</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="HiMirror Mini Premium" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HUzohrOGqT3lom1HcsibkfQ2HuA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/HiMirror-Mini-Premium-9204f4713a2e457cb36be06480d30169.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Lighting</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This smart mirror allows you to stream tutorials on-screen while you get ready.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The instructions can be confusing for some users.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The tablet-mirror hybrid takes getting ready to a different dimension.

The mirror also comes with a skincare analysis component that assesses your skin for wrinkles, fine lines, dark spots, roughness and pores, and monitors the changes in your skin over time to help you stay on top of your skincare goals. Then, it recommends the best products for your skin, based on the assessment as well as environmental factors, like the weather conditions in your area.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The lighting comes in five different setting options modeled after real-life scenarios like Sunny Day, Bright Office and Party Room, so you can test out your look in any situation. "I like how you can make the light brighter or darker as well as warmer and cooler," our reviewer says. "The mirror would be bright enough for all settings without being too harsh."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Best of all, the mirror is adjustable.

"The mirror rotates 180-degrees and smoothly shifts from vertical to horizontal," our reviewer shares. The mirror itself is 1x, but it comes with a magnified 10x mirror that slides out of the side. "I do wish the slide-out mirror could come completely out so you can hold it and use it up close," she noted.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The lighting options are bright, cool-toned, and designed to mimic soft natural sunlight.

In addition to a distortion-free mirror and a 5x close-up mirror, this compact doubles as a power bank to charge your phone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our reviewer found the compact mirror small but mighty.

With a variety of lighting settings and sharp imagery, one reviewer explained that the mirror is high quality and offers a large surface area to see yourself at every angle. "The mini magnifying mirror is very clear and really amplifies my features, which was great for plucking eyebrows," she added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finishing your makeup during your 9am work call? We won't tell if you don't. It's never been easier to listen to music or connect to your phone thanks to the mirror's built-in bluetooth speaker. "I always play music when I'm doing makeup, so I loved that this mirror let me stream through its included speakers," our reviewer says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One downside of this mirror is that it's bulky and somewhat heavy, making it hard to move around.

After honing in on online ratings, we spent a combined total of 48 hours putting the 11 most popular mirrors to the test. We had each of our testers try the lighted makeup mirrors so that they could analyze the performance of each one and write down their insights in the process. In doing so, our testers rated each mirror on a scale of 1 to 5 for four key categories: lighting, quality, design, and stability. Once all the data was collected, we were able to narrow down the original pool of products to the top six lighted makeup mirrors.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Lighting</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you're shopping for a lighted makeup mirror, there are a few specific things to look out for if you want a high-quality option. "Important features are dimmable function for brightness and a function to change color temperature from cool to warm orange hues," says Kinjo, whose celebrity clients include Mindy Kaling, Mary J. Blige, and Uzo Aduba. Our Best Overall pick, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Riki Skinny Smart Vanity Mirror</a>, has five brightness levels to light up all areas of the face.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"For deeper skin tones, a cool white light is horrible lighting and makes skin tones look overly light and ashy," she explains. "Therefore, it is important to have some orangey tungsten hues to warm up the white light. A lighted mirror where you can control the color warmth and get the ideal combo of cool and warm lighting is the right lighted mirror for all complexions."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even if your bathroom or vanity area is already bright, you might still benefit from a makeup mirror with lights. "[A lighted makeup mirror] allows you to see yourself clearly when applying makeup without the cast of shadows typically caused by overhead lighting," says celebrity makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Steve Kassajikian</a>. "This way you always get an even application and blend."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Magnification</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep in mind that a typical mirror is 1x, so when perusing makeup mirror options, consider how close up you want it to be. Most makeup mirrors come with some level of magnification like 3x or 5x, which make an object appear 3 times or 5 times larger, to help amplify harder to see areas. If you'll be using your mirror to do some detailed work like plucking hairs or putting on false lashes, look for higher magnification like 10x.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Extra Features</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While your initial desire for this product may just be a lighted mirror to get ready in front of, the bonus details will seal the deal. Many mirrors come with extra features like USB ports for charging your phone, speakers for playing music, or smart features (like the streaming feature in the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">HiMirror Mini</a>) that make for the ultimate primping station. If you know you'll be taking your mirror on trips, look for designs that are portable enough to travel with and can be mounted in different locations.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are LED lights best for applying makeup?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The short answer is yes. "LED lights are best because [they] will give you a more natural reflection without washing you out," says Kassajikian. Many lighted makeup mirrors on the market use LED lights, but you'll occasionally find some models with fluorescent and incandescent bulbs. LED lights are also more energy-efficient than other types of lighting, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>according to the U.S. Department of Energy</a>. Plus, they might actually keep any makeup that's nearby safe, too. "LED bulbs don't emit heat and cool to the touch, so makeup placed by the mirror won't melt," Kinjo says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-instyle-picks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What is InStyle Picks?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Did you notice the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>InStyle Picks seal of approval</a> at the top of this story?
