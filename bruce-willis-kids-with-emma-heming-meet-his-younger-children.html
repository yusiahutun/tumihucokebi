Fans know and love the <a href=#>Die Hard</a> actor’s older kids, <a href=#><strong>Rumer Willis</strong></a>, <strong>Scout Willis</strong> and <strong><a href=#>Tallulah Willis</a></strong>, but it’s time you learn all about his younger children, Mabel and Evelyn, with the Perfect Stranger actress.</p><p>Bruce and Emma welcomed their first child together, Mabel, in 2012. The <a href=#>Moonlighting</a> star and the English model — who married in 2009 — became the parents of their second daughter, Evelyn, in 2014. Since the Hollywood couple’s little girls arrived, Bruce and Emma have “become like a tribe.”</p><p>“I don’t want to be away from Emma at all. <a href=#>It’s the most singular relationship</a> I’ve ever had in my life,” the Miami Vice alum exclusively shared with Closer Weekly in 2017. While gushing over their enviable marriage, Emma noted the two “have a great foundation.”</p><p>The Red 2 actress told Closer that laughter is the key to their successful relationship. “You’ve got to keep laughing because if you stop, you’re going to have some issues,” she explained.</p><p>Emma revealed the <a href=#>Friends</a> actor loves incorporating humor into his parenting techniques. Because he is “totally silly” and constantly making their daughters smile, the doting mom praised Bruce for being a “great father” to Mabel and Evelyn.</p><p>The former off-Broadway star shares his older children, Rumer, Scout and Tallulah, with his first wife, <a href=#><strong>Demi Moore</strong></a>. The former couple was together for 13 years from 1987 to 2000.</p><p>Bruce and Emma are raising their little girls while <a href=#>doing their best to coparent with Demi</a>, but the situation couldn’t be any easier. Not only does the <a href=#>trio share an amicable relationship</a>, but <a href=#>Emma said she has “so much respect”</a> for the Ghost alum.</p><p>“She welcomed me into her family like I welcomed her into ours,” she sweetly told Closer during an event in 2019. “I have so much respect for how Bruce and Demi worked through their divorce to be able to put their children first. I learned so much from that and grew so much from watching that.”</p><p><span>In March 2022, Emma and Demi, along with Bruce’s eldest daughters, posted a photo of the star on Instagram with a caption revealing that he is stepping away from acting.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“To Bruce’s amazing supporters, as a family, we wanted to share that our beloved Bruce has been experiencing some health issues and has recently been diagnosed with Aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities,” they wrote. “As a result of this and with much consideration, Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him.”</span></p><p><span>The post went on to say that this has been a “really challenging time” for the entire family as they continue to navigate through it as a “strong family unit.” Just days before Emma shared the emotional post on Instagram, she posted a photo from her wedding to Bruce to celebrate their 13th anniversary. The entrepreneur also posted a birthday video tribute to her husband in the weeks leading up to the announcement, featuring photos of the couple and their two kids.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to learn more about Mabel and Evelyn.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46bqa6blWLEqrjLoqpmo5mZwG7DyK2fZp2doq5utMSmoKefXaKypsCMoaCsZamkwq%2BzxKtknKCZobGzsc1o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./coby-and-penny-as-partners-ken-rosato-isn-t-married-yet-reason-of-solitary-life-girlfriend-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Coby and Penny as Partners, Ken Rosato, isn't Married Yet: Reason of Solitary Life.
