The Holy Scriptures were written with the divine guidance of the Holy Spirit by prophets, shepherds, nobility and others. However, did you know that other books never made it to the Bible? To think there is a book out there that didn't cut it is baffling. The Book of Enoch has always been shrouded in mystery, with religious scholars distancing themselves from it and congregants being advised against it. So, why stay away from the Book of Enoch?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9c272cbb8aeb4a0e.jpeg><p class=align-left>Borrowing from the numerous narratives in the Bible, it seems like the forbidden things are always the most sought after. However, the consequences have been dire for the ones that failed to abide by the set rules.</p><p class=align-left>Today, religious scholars and Christians have distanced themselves from the Book of Enoch for various reasons. You have probably heard about it and wondered why it is not in the Bible. So, who wrote the Book of Enoch, and why is it forbidden?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8ff693809fd9b7de.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is Adonitology?

So, what is the book all about, and why do different religious factions, including religious scholars, approach it with scepticism?</p><p class=align-left>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Book of Enoch</a> is a pseudepigraphical work (not included in any canon of scripture). The bookâ€™s only complete extant version is an Ethiopic translation of a previous Greek translation made in Palestine</p><p class=align-left>It possesses <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">apocalyptic accounts </a>with visions and revelations about the end of times. It has five sections, which talk about the fall of angels, how Nephilim (referred to as giants in the Bible) arose, why the great flood took place, some astronomy and other prophecies.</p><p class=align-left>Does this sound familiar? You cannot help but compare the book's writings with the Book of Revelations, the last in the New Testament. However, the difference is that the Book of Revelations was accepted and is in the <a href=#>Holy Scriptures</a>, but Enoch is not. The Book of Enoch's main theme is judgment for the wicked and blessings for the righteous.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2453fb01f94bdc72.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The Whittaker inbred family story: Everything you should know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Who was Enoch in the Bible? The Book of Enoch has gained immense popularity because of its name, Enoch. He was the great-great-great-grandson of Adam. Genesis 5:22-24 states:</p>After he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked faithfully with God for 300 years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Enoch lived a total of 365 years. Enoch walked faithfully with God; then, he was no more because God took him away.<h2>Why was the Book of Enoch removed from the Bible?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8ff693809fd9b7de.jpg><p class=align-left>The Book of Enoch is not in the Bible. However, other people assume it is part of the Catholic deuterocanonical books, but it isn't. The book is popular and even quoted in other religious scripture, including the Book of Jude. So, what is the primary reason the book is not<a href=#> part of the Bible</a>?</p><h3>Enoch did not write it</h3><p class=align-left>Many scholars have agreed that the Books of Enoch is a compilation of different texts from different authors and was not composed by Enoch in the Old Testament. Historians date the oldest sections of the book to 300 B.C.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f1bee85e84711e5c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best books by African authors you should read right now</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Scholars have also found out that the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">youngest sections</a> date to 100 A.D. From the timeline, you can easily tell that it was written around 3000 to 4000 years after Enoch walked the earth.</p><p class=align-left>The fact that the book's authors wanted to make it sound like Enoch wrote is also suspect. The writers used Enoch's name to attract attention and persuade people to adopt their view on a certain social matter.</p><h3>God didn't inspire the book</h3><p class=align-left>Another major reason that the Book of Enoch is not in the Bible is that it doesn't demonstrate the marks of inspiration from God. It is popular, but that doesn't mean God inspired it. Even though a few early churches advocated for using the book in churches, mostly because Jude mentioned it, people later changed their minds about it.</p><h3>The Book isnâ€™t aligned with the Bible</h3><p class=align-left>Religious scholars have agreed that the Book of Enoch was not composed to teach about God or apply Biblical truth but for other purposes. For instance, the first section, The Book of Watchers, talks mostly about priestly marriage, which was controversial in the Jewish community.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/819d5fb99a2cb0a3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Borat: 10 fun facts about the movie. Is it real?</span></p></a><h3>Jews and Christians rejected the book</h3><p class=align-left>The Jewish community, before Christ, were aware of the Book of Enoch and did not accept it since it didn't meet the standards of being considered an inspired scripture. On the other hand, Christians have rejected it.</p><p class=align-left>And the most interesting thing is that almost all branches of Christianity do not accept it. This includes the Roman Catholics Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, Protestant Churches and many others.</p><p class=align-left>The most significant reason the Book of Enoch is not in the Bible is that the Holy Spirit did not inspire it. On top of this, Jude quoting it doesn't make it inspired.</p><p class=align-left>The book also goes <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">against Christian teachings</a> and has a reputation for paganism. It has false teachings that contradict what other <a href=#>books in the Bible</a> teach and tries to create additional doctrines.</p><h2>Why stay away from the Book of Enoch?</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0b53efa28396369f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best Bible movies to watch with your family</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2453fb01f94bdc72.jpeg><p class=align-left>Of course, there is nothing wrong with reading the Book of Enoch. It is like any other text you can read, like a published book. However, please read it with wisdom and consider the different religious factions' reservations against it. The Holy Spirit neither inspired it nor is it reliable.</p><p class=align-left>One thing you need to remember about the Book of Enoch is that it is difficult to read, considering it is laden with mystery and symbolism. Therefore, you'll need time to understand what different texts mean.</p><h2>FAQs about the books of Enoch</h2><li>Is it a sin to read the book of Enoch?

Even though there is debate, Jude appears to be quoting the Book of Enoch in Jude 14-15.</li><li>Is the book of Enoch mentioned in the New Testament? Yes, the Book of Enoch is referenced in the New Testament in the Book of Jude. However, more is needed to validate the book.</li><li>What did God promise Enoch? God promised Enoch that he would never flood the world again. On top of this, He promised that He would call upon the children of Noah, which means that He would invite them to accept the gospel.</li><li>Who is the messiah in the book of Enoch? The Book of Enoch talks about a messiah called the Son of Man with divine attributes. The writings further state that the messiah will act directly during the final judgement and sit on the throne of glory.</li><li>What does the book of Enoch say about heaven? The Second Book of Enoch is popular for its description of multiple heaves. According to the book, there are ten heavens, which the writer describes in various ways.</li><li>Are there hidden secrets in the book of Enoch?

Other scriptures are quite straightforward as it is like God himself wrote them.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9db09fa0b0e5200b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 20 richest pastors in the world and their net worth in 2024</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Many have asked, "Why stay away from the Book of Enoch?" The big problem with the book is that people need to explain it adequately. On top of this, it has been rejected by virtually all religious factions, as the Holy Spirit did not inspire it.
