Britney’s attorney, Mathew Rosengart—who was responsible for <a rel=noopener href=#>terminating Britney’s</a><a rel=noopener href=#>&nbsp;conservatorship</a> in November 2021—also attended the nuptials. “Britney walked herself down the aisle. She looked absolutely stunning in her main dress,” a source told <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a> at the time. “She cried happy tears at some moments.”</p><p>Britney’s father, <a rel=noopener href=#>Jamie Spears</a>; mother, <a rel=noopener href=#>Lynn Spears</a>; sister, <a rel=noopener href=#>Jamie Lynn Spears</a>; and brother, Bryan Spears, didn’t attend the wedding. Her sons, Sean Preston and Jayden James—whom she shares with her ex-husband, Kevin Federline—were also absent from the nuptials. “[Preston and Jayden] are happy for their mom and they are hopeful that Sam and Britney are starting a great future together,” Mark Vincent Kaplan, Federline’s attorney, told People at the time. “It’s their night and they didn’t want to take away from them.”</p><p>A year after their wedding, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TMZ</a> broke the news in August 2023 that Britney and Sam had split after he accused her of cheating him, which led to a fight between them. After the fight, Sam moved out of his and Britney’s house and into his own place. “It’s only a matter of time before Sam files for divorce,” a source told TMZ.</p><p>The news came three months after <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TMZ</a> reported in another article that Britney and Sam were having marriage issues, including Britney getting physical with Sam and the two having frequent screaming matches. Sources also told TMZ at the time that Britney and Sam’s fights had become so intense that security had to intervene.</p><p>But back to <a rel=noopener href=#>Britney Spears’ prenup</a> with Sam Asghari. What is Britney and Sam have a prenuptial agreement? Read on for what we know about <a href=# id=auto-tag_britney-spears data-tag=britney-spears>Britney Spears</a>‘ prenup before her wedding to Sam Asghari and how it compares to her past husbands.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-s-in-britney-spears-prenup-with-sam-asghari>What’s in Britney Spears’ prenup with Sam Asghari?</h2><p>What’s in <a rel=noopener href=#>Britney Spears’ prenup</a> with Sam Asghari? <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>TMZ</a> reported in June 2022 that Britney and Sam signed a prenup stating that Sam wouldn’t receive any money Britney made before their wedding date if they divorced in the future.</p><p>Sam confirmed in an Instagram Story in September 2021 that he and Britney had plans to sign an “iron-clad prenup” after their engagement that month. His post came after thousands of fans, including actress Octavia Spencer, told Britney to sign a prenup before she married Sam.&nbsp;“Make him <a href=# rel=noopener>sign a prenup</a>,” Octavia commented at the time on Britney’s engagement post. In response to the comments, Sam took to his Instagram to joke about how he and Britney planned to sign a prenup to “protect his jeep and shoe collection.” He wrote,&nbsp;“Thank you everyone who is concerned about The Prenup! Of course we’re getting [an] iron clad prenup to protect my jeep and shoe collection in case she dumps me one day.” He accompanied his post with two laughing emojis.</p><p>That same month, Britney’s attorney, Mathew Rosengart, filed court documents to remove her father, Jamie Spears, as her conservator, so he wouldn’t have any involvement in her prenuptial agreement with Sam. “Ms. Spears and the undersigned counsel are in the process of engaging a family law attorney to craft a prenuptial agreement,” Rosengart said in a court filing at the time. “The prenuptial agreement process will require communications with and cooperation from the Conservator of her Estate but, as referenced above and well-established on record, given that Ms. Spears’s relationship with that Conservator (her father) is broken, Mr. Spears’s continued involvement would impede the ability to negotiate and consummate a contract that all can agree is in Ms. Spears’s best interests.”</p><p>A source told Us Weekly in May 2022 that <a rel=noopener href=#>prenup negotiations</a> between Britney and Sam were taking “longer than usual.” “The talks have been taking longer than usual,” the insider said. “Sam wants substantial increases for every fives years they are married, should it end.” The source claimed that the discussions were taking “longer than usual” because Sam “doesn’t” want to “end up penniless if they separate.” Despite the long negotiations, the insider added that Britney and Sam’s legal teams remained “respectable” throughout the process.&nbsp; “Britney’s staying out of the entire process,” the source said. “She’s just letting her lawyers hash it out with Sam’s team.”</p><p>According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Us Weekly</a>, Britney and Sam’s prenup states that Sam will receive “$1 million per every two years of their marriage,” with a cap of $10 million after 15 years. Sam also waived any claims to Britney’s music catalog and his name wasn’t on the deed of their shared home. Instead, the couple agreed to put the house into a limited liability company (LLC.) A source told Us Weekly at the time Britney and Sam signed their prenup that Britney found the details of the document “overwhelming.”</p><p>A source told TMZ in August 2023, however, that Britney’s prenup states that Sam receives no money in the event of the divorce, as well as prevents him from seeking spousal support. He can, however, keep any gifts or cars that Britney gave him throughout their marriage. The sources also told TMZ that Britney’s prenup has an “extensive confidentiality clause” that prohibits Sam from talking about his relationship with Britney. The sources also predicted to TMZ that Britney and Sam will likely negotiate a deal, where he’ll receive several hundred thousand dollars in exchange for another confidentiality clause that will require Sam to return any money if he violates the non-disclosure agreement.</p><p>After Britney and Sam’s separation in August 2023, a source told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> that Sam was “attempting to negotiate concessions beyond his prenup and threatening to go public with extraordinarily embarrassing information about Britney unless he gets paid.” The inside continued, “So that’s what Sam is focused on.”</p><p>Another source claimed that Britney’s team has “protected” her amid her divorce from Sam and that “parting will be respectful.” It’s blackmail and it’ll never happen,” the source said. Another source confirmed to Page Six after Britney and Sam’s wedding in 2022 that their prenup is in her favor. “Britney and Sam signed a prenup in her favor,” the insider said. “Any money she made before the wedding is protected.”</p><p>A representative for Sam denied the claims in a statement to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>E! News</a> in August 2023. “There are many claims that Sam is challenging the prenup and threatening to exploit his ex-wife with videos,” the representative said. “However, all these claims are false, as no negative intention has ever been directed towards her and never will be.” The representative continued, “Sam has always and will always support her.”</p><p>The statement came after Sam broke his silence on his divorce from Britney in an Instagram Story on August 17, 2023. “After 6 years of love and commitment to each other my wife and I have decided to end our journey together,” he wrote. “We will hold onto the love and respect we have for each other and I wish her the best always. Shit happens. Asking for privacy seems rediculous [sic] so I will just ask for everyone including media to be kind and thoughtful.”</p><p>Before her marriage to Sam,&nbsp;Britney was married to Kevin Federline from 2004 to 2007. The former couple share two sons: Sean Preston and Jayden James. According to TMZ, <a href=# rel=noopener>Kevin and Britney signed a prenup</a> before their marriage. After their divorce, Kevin received a $1.3 million settlement, as well as $20,000 per month child support. Britney also had to pay $250,000 to Kevin in lawyer fees. Britney was also married to Jason Allen Alexander for 55 hours in 2005, however, their marriage was annulled.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-britney-spears-net-worth>What is Britney Spears’ net worth?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>What is <a href=# rel=noopener>Britney Spears’ net worth</a>? Britney Spears’ net worth is an estimated $60 million, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a>. However, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports that Britney Spears’ net worth is even higher at $70 million. This figure is only a slight increase from her net worth a few years ago according to court documents obtained by Entertainment Tonight, which found <a href=# rel=noopener>Britney Spears’ net worth</a> to be $59,079,755.76 at the end of 2018.</p><p>In 2018, Forbes reported that <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Britney earned $30 million</a> that year. Much of her income in 2018 came from music sales, her Las Vegas residency, “Britney: Piece of Me,” which ran from December 2013 to 2017, as well as her successful perfumes, including Fantasy and Curious. The Hollywood Reporter reported in 2013 that <a href=# rel=noopener>Britney earned $30 million</a> that year in perfume sales alone. As for her Las Vegas show, Forbes reported in 2017 that Britney grossed more than <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">$103 million</a> across less than 250 shows. On the TV side, The Wrap reported in 2012 that <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Britney was paid $15 million</a> for her role as a judge on FOX’s The X Factor.</p><p>All of these earnings occurred during <a href=# rel=noopener>Britney’s conservatorship</a> was created in February 2008 and was terminated in November 2021. At the time the conservatorship was created, Britney’s father, Jamie, and her attorney, Andrew Wallet, were assigned as her co-conservators. In March 2019, Wallet resigned as Britney’s co-conservator, leaving Jamie as the sole conservator over Britney’s estate. A conservatorship is known as a legal guardianship and is granted to those who are incapable of making decisions, such as someone with a mental disability or dementia. As her conservator, Jamie exercised full control over Britney’s financial and personal decisions. The conservatorship also granted him access to her medical records, allowing him to limit visitors for her, negotiate opportunities and manage her financial assets. (Wallet previously had control over the financial side of Britney’s life before he resigned.)</p><p>Britney’s financial decisions have been well-documented in court records throughout the years. According to documents obtained by Entertainment Tonight in 2019, <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>Britney spent $400,000</a> on living expenses in 2018, which included $66,000 on household supplies and $70,000 in travel. Britney’s largest expense in 2018 were her legal and conservatorship fees, which amounted to $1.1 million. Jamie received $128,000 as Britney’s conservator in 2018. In November 2021, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda J. Penny ruled that Britney’s conservatorship was officially terminated. The decision was made after the court found that Britney was capable of managing her own multi-million-dollar estate and determined that the circumstances that led to her conservatorship’s creation in 2008 are no longer relevant. “The court finds and determines that the conservatorship of the person and the estate is no longer required therefore effective today…it’s hereby terminated,” Judge Penny said in court.</p><p>For her wedding to Sam, Britney wore a custom off-the-shoulder Versace dress for her wedding, with a leg-revealing slit up one side and a classic white white veil with satin edges, which she wore as she walked down the aisle to Elvis’ “Can’t Help Falling in Love,” according to <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a>. Sam also wore a black Versace tuxedo. “Crafted in a delicate white silk cady, the design features a portrait neckline that wraps around the shoulders and comes together with a stream of pearl buttons,” Donatella Versace, the creative director of the Versace fashion house, told People at the time. “The seamline of the bodice follows the corset boning that narrows at the waist. The column silhouette is cut with a front leg-slit, while the back pleats from the waist cascade into a three-meter train.” She continued, “The veil is crafted from four and a half meters of silk tulle trimmed in silk satin. Look was completed with tulle gloves embellished with pearls and matching white satin pumps.”</p><p>For their wedding rings, Britney and Sam exchanged custom bands by Stephanie Gottlieb. Britney’s wedding ring included two platinum eternity bands. The first was a classic round diamond band in a shared prong setting, while the second was a marquise diamond band set east to west in a bezel eternity band. Both gems were around two carats. As for Sam, he received a classic platinum 5mm band. In total, Britney wore more than 60 carats of diamonds retailing a total of $570,000, according to Us Weekly. Her wedding ceremony was 10 minutes, and it was officiated by Reverend Clint Hufft, who also married Paris Hilton and Carter Reum in the fall of 2021.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-sam-asghari-s-net-worth>What is Sam Asghari’s net worth?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>What is <a href=# rel=noopener>Sam Asghari’s net worth</a>?
