The brand only entered the fashion sphere in 2015, but has managed to tap into the zeitgeist of people wearing activewear out and about for everyday tasks as well as in the gym.

The relaxed shape is super easy to style, and the appliqué varsity lettering has a fun, retro air about it.

The brand's core is rooted in yoga, but it also has some extremely stylish, durable options for runner girlies.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/472369a2a390-lululemon-jacket.jpg><p>I love the clean, tapered silhouette of Lululemon's Define jacket, cut from its stretchy, sweat-wicking Nulu fabric. For chilly early morning runs, thumbholes are a must, and this piece even features cuffs with an extra flap that folds over your fingers for added warmth. The jewel in the crown? The elastic in the zip doubles up as an emergency hair tie, so there's really no excuse for getting caught short.</p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£108.00 AT LULULEMON</p></a><h2 data-gid=eeL_Ykhv7V>Girlfriend Collective</h2><p id=e6b_GcEmf6j data-wc=43>Sustainable label Girlfriend Collective was founded by husband and wife duo Ellie and Quang Dinh in 2016, borne out of Ellie's frustration at not being able to find eco-friendly activewear. The pieces are created from recycled materials, including plastic bottles and fishing nets.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/535c87e4044a-girlfriend-collective-skort.jpg><p>I'm determined to get into tennis this summer (and cajole my friends into taking it up too). A form of exercise whereby we can still chat? It's essentially the perfect sport. For maximum court chic, Girlfriend Collective's Float Cass skort feels extremely elegant, featuring an elasticated high waist, a side split and a handy slim pocket for your phone.</p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£55.00 AT M&S&nbsp;</p></a><h2 data-gid=e-nbq7inPI>Live The Process</h2><p id=elIpw7YHP6h8 data-wc=65>Barre girlies need to get acquainted with Live The Process. Founded in 2013, the label has a wellness angle to its ethos, promising to support your "continual transformation—on an emotional, physical, intellectual and spiritual level". The brand is unrivalled when it comes to chic cut-outs and clean-line cardigans, all with a balletic feel. And don't get me started on the leg warmers. Colour me tempted.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/e3fd0982a278-live-the-process-cardigan.jpg><p>I've fallen hard for Live The Process' Juno cardigan, and can you blame me? Created from viscose and regenerated cellulose, I adore the pretty bow detailing on this timeless knit. It would look great alongside leggings and ballet flats (or with a champagne-hued silky slip if you're looking to get some extra wear out of it).&nbsp;</p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£186.00 AT LIVE THE PROCESS&nbsp;</p></a><h2>Alo</h2><p id=eHAplQUlafm data-wc=61>Yoga-centric Alo was founded back in 2007 in Los Angeles by childhood friends Danny Harris and Marco DeGeorge with the intention of creating a line that yogis could wear to "elevate" their practice. Celebrities such as <a class=hm-link href=#>Hailey Bieber</a>, <a class=hm-link href=#>Kendall Jenner</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Taylor Swift</a> catapulted the brand into the street style stratosphere, proving that Alo's pieces aren't to be confined to studio.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/3e0624ba3ce0-alo-bra.jpg><p>I'm a sucker for white contrasting topstitching against black, and this bra by Alo is now at the top of my activewear wish list. The brand has ranked the support level as 'medium' - perfect for less intense workouts and I love the elegance of the low scooped back.</p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£76.00 AT ALO</p></a><h2 data-gid=eW6jf8zNU34>J.Lindeberg</h2><p id=eL8Mhm3dino data-wc=49>Since 1996, J.Lindeberg has worked tirelessly to change the golfing fashion landscape and inject the fairways with a splash of pizzazz, shifting away from stuffiness and convention. The brand has partnered with some of the biggest names in the sport, and represents the height of style for many golfers.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/19db4029a7c8-jlindeberg-dress.jpg><p>Cut from TX Jersey, this piece by J.Lindeberg is giving 60s glam, and I can't get enough. The A-line shape is flattering and classic, and I love the drama of the playful geometric print. It features internal shorts for ease of movement and to eliminate any potential wardrobe malfunctions while you perfect your swing.&nbsp;</p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£120.00 £72.00&nbsp;</p></a><h2><strong>Vuori</strong></h2><p id=etaqbgHUPf data-wc=39>Inspired by California's coastal lifestyle, this label aims to inspire people to "live vibrant, healthy lives".

It's almost as though the bolder the print, the more you're drawing attention to yourself and your skills/energy levels (or lack thereof). Gingham is one of my all-time favourites, and this purple mini skirt by Vuori, cut from its sweat-wicking BreatheInterlock fabric, feels classic and quietly elegant.</p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£70.00 AT VUORI&nbsp;</p></a><h2><strong>Anine Bing Sport</strong></h2><p id=eLhVt3c2_Tw data-wc=29>Fashion insider favourite Anine Bing is perhaps best known for its extremely covetable accessories, but its sportswear selection is second to none.

Clean graphic lines, minimalist stripes and high-impact chevrons feature across the board. And yet, where prints are concerned, the look is so considered and cool, and each piece is infused with a glamorous, vintage air. The 1920s-esque tennis dresses honestly just hit different - I want one purely so I can feel like an Agatha Christie debutante, if not for any other purpose.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/6ca1a5c0b0a3-tory-sport-tennis-dress.jpg><p>Inspired by the look that defined 1970s sportswear, this V-neck tennis dress exudes polish and clean-cut elegance.

Cast your mind back to the days of , the brand's founder Anjhe Marcus was even responsible for designing the training outfits. Look no further for quality, performance-driven leggings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/ed0f213292ec-lucas-hugh-leggings.jpg><p>Cut from an Italian polyamide-elastane blend, Lucas Hugh's Stealth leggings are designed to be super soft to the touch.

It focuses on meticulously tested fabrics and fits to make your workout as seamless as possible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/55f3488b220c-sefi-crop-top.jpg><p>Made from a moisture-wicking, antibacterial nylon-spandex blend, this salmon pink bra by Sefi features a super flattering halter neckline and removable padding so you can taper the fit to your style of workout.</p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£46.00 AT SEFI&nbsp;</p></a><h2><strong>Vaara&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=e55PVWSC2K6w data-wc=43>Founded by Tatiana Korsakova, London-based label Vaara is the capsule wardrobe devotee's activewear dream. The cuts are minimalist and luxe, and the colour palette is decidedly understated. And I am pleased to report that I am extremely tempted by its regular 'Daywear' section.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/1f7dcdd16bcb-vaara-jacket.jpg><p>Chic windbreaker options are few and far between, but Vaara's ivory polyamide version has caught my eye. I love the ruched sleeves for added flair and it has a distinctly contemporary feel, no 80s colourblocking in sight. It can be packed into the front pouch for on-the-go ease - ideal for out-and-proud Gorpcore girlies.</p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£285.00 £175.00 AT VAARA&nbsp;</p></a><h2><strong>The Upside</strong></h2><p id=eIdGwCnr08Jh data-wc=38>Aussie label The Upside is home to some seriously gorgeous prints, in response to its founder Jodhi Meares' dissatisfaction with "limited, bland" yoga clothing. The prints are lively and luxe, but the brand also excels in mid-priced preppy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/cc6174487626-the-upside-cricket-sweater.jpg><p>This vintage-inspired cotton sweater by The Upside features a slouchy fit and a stripe-lined high-impact V-neckline.

If your sport of choice involves battling against the elements, you 100% need to check out its extensive outwear, spanning from cosy fleeces to heavy-duty puffer jackets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/e1e2eb5e4768-varley-sherpa-puffer.jpg><p>As someone who actively avoids the puffer, I've actually surprised myself by taking a shine to Varley's Wynn coat. With a cardigan-like appeal, this piece is crafted from sumptuous sherpa for maximum warmth. I'm really into the fold-over pocket detailing as it feels fresh and a little bit different.</p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£252.00 AT VARLEY&nbsp;</p></a><h2><strong>Perfect Moment</strong></h2><p id=eiyi3uJn0jLx data-wc=65>In my humble opinion holidays are supposed to be hot and languid - the idea of a ski trip sounds hideous. The only factor that could possibly cause me to reconsider? A Perfect Moment après 'fit. Bold, graphic and categorically high impact, a holiday wardrobe packed with its base layers, patterned ski separates and all-in-ones would turn any snowy getaway into an achingly chic affair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/96a3572692c2-perfect-moment-skiwear.jpg><p>Whittling it down to just one Perfect Moment piece to spotlight was nothing short of agonising. But I've swerved puffer metallics and vibrant houndstooth prints to bring you this navy dream. Featuring the brand's signature fitted, flared silhouette it is constructed from Toray Dermizax technology to keep you comfortable and dry while on the slopes and I love the bold stripe accents.</p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£790.00 AT PERFECT MOMENT</p></a><h2><strong>Adidas by Stella McCartney</strong></h2><p id=euvKImamDXhM data-wc=49>Sportswear giant Adidas' partnership with Stella McCartney is brilliant for pieces that have an interesting edge. Plus, for eco-warriors, many of its pieces are made from post-industrial and post-consumer waste - plastic bottles for instance - enabling "the highest impact performance" to coincide perfectly with a minimised environmental impact.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/d0f9d293c4a6-stella-mccartney-trainers.jpg><p>I'm actually on the hunt for some new running shoes at the moment, and this pair from Adidas by Stella McCartney is going to be pretty hard to beat.
