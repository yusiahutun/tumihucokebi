"I hope my story provides an example for businesses and consumers of how quickly a successful business and reputation can be damaged by false information and social media bullying."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy the Office of Attorney Dave Wishnew</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a statement to PEOPLE, Neely says the couple believes they were merely defending themselves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We are stunned. We did what consumer advocates say to do: When you are wronged, you fight back," the statement reads. "We were unhappy with a situation, so we complained like anyone would. This court decision tells consumers not to speak up for fear of fat legal bills and painful judgments. If this is the cost of standing up for what's right, we should have given in to start with. But we hope to prevail in the end. We'd love nothing more than to put this behind us and focus on raising our five-month-old child."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Moldovans hired Polito's company to photograph their wedding and related events in October 2014. The couple began emailing Polito for high-resolution photos just weeks after the wedding, though their contract stated that the couple would receive the photographs when their entire wedding album was complete. At that point, the couple had not yet completed an order form or paid the $125 fee for the photo album's cover, which Polito gets custom made from Italy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Moldovans objected to the fee and according to a court petition, Polito emailed Neely on January 14, 2015 and "requested that Neely select the album cover, with the intention of waiving the cost of the cover."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy the Office of Attorney Dave Wishnew</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple went on camera with a local news station in January 2015 to complain that Polito's company was holding their photographs "hostage." This ignited a social media campaign and press tour that focused on the Moldovan's version of the story and eventually led to the demise of Polito's company, according to the photographer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple managed to rally hundreds of their followers into leaving negative reviews and comments on popular wedding photography websites and Polito's social pages.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It instantly burned down the reputation that Andrea built up over 12 years," Polito's attorney, Dave Wishnew, tells PEOPLE. "She didn't book any more weddings after that. It was done. The negative reviews destroyed her reputation, and in a business that is largely word-of-mouth, no one was referring her."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The attacks left Polito humiliated, and she found herself downplaying her name out of fear people would search her online and see the stories.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I used to love getting out of bed in the morning, I was excited and I had a purpose, and they took it away," she says. "For the past two-and-a-half years, I've felt completely worthless."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy the Office of Attorney Dave Wishnew</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wishnew argued that the Moldovans' negative social media posts about Polito's company were more about promoting themselves than about their photographs. "They admit in their messages and the evidence in court that they wanted it to go viral, and they wanted it to ruin Andrea's business," he says. "The more traffic that goes to Neely's blog, the more they can have sponsored posts, and more sponsored posts means more money."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Dallas County jury agreed with Wishnew that the Moldovans' social media campaign was done out of malice and that Polito had followed the terms of the contract they initially agreed to. Finally, Polito's name was cleared.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When the jury came out and said that, it felt like I got 'me' back, and that's all I ever wanted. I just wanted my name back, for me," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wishnew adds that he was thrilled when the verdict came in. "Andrea has been through hell and back," he says. "It was about clearing a good person's name who was dragged through the mud for a long time. For Andrea, this is the first step to rebuilding a reputation that was torn down."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Neely's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Twitter page</a> is now set to private. She last posted a sponsored article <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>on her blog</a> on July 31 about skin care products.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy the Office of Attorney Dave Wishnew</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wishnew shared advice to other small business owners if they ever find themselves in a similar situation. "If people put out false and defamatory statements and outright lies about your business, you can stand up for yourself," he says. "No one is challenging a customer's right to express an opinion, or their point of view, or challenge their freedom of speech, but with that freedom comes consequences if you lie."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Today, Polito hopes she can restart her life and get back to the way things were before <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>with her reinvigorated photography business</a>. She admits that it took years for her to build a name in her industry, and it will take time again for her to rebuild it back. But she hopes her story informs business owners about their rights and warns online commenters about the consequences of their actions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"People will go online, write something, and go about their day," she says. "They have no clue what happens on the other side of that keyboard. My life fell apart. My business was destroyed. And when my business was destroyed, it felt like part of me was, too."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iquqK6jKKlrZ2imsC1e9Oer5qrXaOyuLjYsJydq12stbB5z66ZpaGTocZursCsn56cXayypbDIp55mqJikwbCz0ZqnoZ2iYry3sdFmaGttXZuypnnOq5ueqpWZerW7jKmYsmVhYrqquMuipqdllqS%2FbrDEn5immaSevK97</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dee-wallace-daughter-meet-actress-gabrielle-stone.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dee Wallace Daughter: Meet Actress Gabrielle Stone</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-farmer-wants-wife-reunion-addresses-pregnancy-scandal-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Farmer Wants a Wife reunion addresses THAT pregnancy scandal</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
