the breakdown of their marriage was the lack of time they spent together, which could explain why the pair â€“ who both live in Royal Lodge, Windsor and spend a lot of time together after their reduced royal duties â€“ have become close following their divorce.</p><p id=ewvPiAZFfNc data-wc=27>The Duchess confessed to Ernie Manouse in 2010: "My deal was that I was marrying my man, who happened to be a prince and a naval officer.</p><p id=ewpgZHsFhMl data-wc=45>"But what I got was not the man, I got the palace and didnâ€™t get him... and the courtiers told me I had to go to Buckingham Palace and he had to go to sea. For our marriage, I saw him 40 days a year."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/82e4b12c8587-gettyimages-1157455192.jpg><p id=efB5A87Z3P5u data-wc=59>By 2013, Fergie was fending off questions about their close relationship. When asked if she and Andrew would remarry during a promotional event for her childrenâ€™s book, she coyly replied: "Heâ€™s still my handsome prince, heâ€™ll always be my handsome prince. Itâ€™s lovely that we are such a family and the story has a happy ending all the time."</p><p id=e7QPg98py0IW data-wc=24>Fans noticed it wasn't an outright denial, and she took the same approach five years later when she described their relationship as a "fairytale."</p><p id=e6t4etkejgo_ data-wc=40>"We're so happy with the way we are right now. We enjoy each other's company; we allow each other to blossom. I know it sounds like a fairy tale but that's the way we are," she told the Daily Mail.</p><p id=eo6VgKghUUSU data-wc=40>Recalling her wedding day, she continued: "July 23, 1986 was the happiest day of my life. Andrew is the best man I know. What he does for Britain is incredible; no one knows how hard he works for his country.</p><p id=e2ZJRG93IZR6 data-wc=53>"My duty is to him. I am so proud of him. I stand by him and always will. The way we are is our fairy tale. Although we are not a couple, we really believe in each other. The Yorks are a united family. We've shown it. You saw it at the wedding.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/24b2d157f41e-gettyimages-1267515430.jpg><p id=egGCieUN4yZZ data-wc=50>"We stand up for each other, fight for each other. We're totally respectful of each other's position and thoughts and we listen to each other. Our children listen to us, too. And we sit round the table and have afternoon tea together. It's a very important part of our lives."</p><p id=eIPwOmM1rcsh data-wc=23>Since then, Sarah has praised their ability to co-parent their kids and sustain "a strong family unit" during a chat with<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;The Telegraph</a>.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Prince Andrew on remarriage</h2><p id=e42SaXa0U2Eg data-wc=79>Three years after they got divorced, there were already rumours of the former royal couple rekindling their romance. Prince Andrew spoke about his living situation with Tatler in 2000: "We are not just doing it for the children. We are doing it for our own benefit too. I donâ€™t rule remarriage out and I certainly donâ€™t rule it in. If ever the opportunity arose, I do not know what I would do, as it is not in the plan."</p><p id=eOUNO_K3DhVC data-wc=37>At the time, Fergie also added: "There has been no discussion on remarriage or reconciliation or any other such word... I simply say if it should happen, great. It is not in, nor is it ruled out."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1f8cb096663e-scoopunit09281rt3.jpg><p id=eSLldQ_-kr6h data-wc=59>Meanwhile, the late Queen Elizabeth II's son seemed to have changed his tune by 2010. Backtracking about the possibility of exchanging vows for the second time, he told the<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;Daily Mail</a>: "No. We are both in a better place. It's because we are in a better place which is probably why we are able to remain such close friends."</p><p id=eeRwnCZPNAVm data-wc=52>Their commitment to their friendship has been demonstrated amid the couple facing adversity together. They acted as pillars of support for one another during the Prince's settlement with Virginia Giuffre, his <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>car-crash interview with Emily Maitlis</a> which will be documented in <a class=hm-link href=#>Netflix film Scoop</a>, and Sarah's <a class=hm-link href=#>skin cancer</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>breast cancer</a> diagnoses.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Insiders on a second royal wedding</h2><p id=eSHl7TcS5eRe data-wc=15>Others have also suggested that a romantic reunion is "extremely unlikely" â€“ although not impossible.&nbsp;</p><p id=eBnw5V2T4o6d data-wc=41>Royal commentator and author of Queen Elizabeth II: Pocket Giants Victoria Arbiter has revealed that the reason that Sarah and the Prince will not remarry is due to them not being prepared to disrupt the status quo of their current relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/157f9f966992-gettyimages-107898771.jpg><p id=ek9X1GikoDAe data-wc=34>Speaking to GB News, the author said: "Thereâ€™s long been speculation regarding whether or not Andrew and Fergie will remarry. But their current situation seems to suit them both well so why complicate things?"</p><p id=e_zQs_EHFG_q data-wc=40>She went on to say: "Fergieâ€™s previously said theyâ€™re the happiest divorced couple she knows so thereâ€™s little to be gained by remarrying. Theyâ€™ve always shown immense loyalty towards each other and clearly their relationship works exactly as it is."</p><p id=encM6eRZznCG data-wc=35>Meanwhile, Phil Dampier, a royal commentator who reported on their 1986 royal wedding, said: "I would never say never, but I think itâ€™s extremely unlikely that the Duke and Duchess of York will ever remarry.</p><p id=eNbSwkOoMd3U data-wc=32>"They are best friends and he will undoubtedly have been helping her after her recent illness," he continued. "But I donâ€™t think they are romantically involved, that ship sailed 30 years ago."&nbsp;</p><p id=e1NMxhgnXr data-wc=13><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>7 royals who remarried after divorce: From King Charles to Princess Anne</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
