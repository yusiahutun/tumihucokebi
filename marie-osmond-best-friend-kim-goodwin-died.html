Being human, I know there are times when something big needs to happen in order to get us off the track we’re on, and in a better direction. These events often help us get “outside” our present thinking, and “inside” what life choices we should really be focusing on. I previously mentioned on my social media that my friend Kimmy—who has been my hair and make-up person for over 25 years and is one of my dearest friends (actually he’s family to me)—is experiencing a very serious health event. His first surgery involved putting stents in to prepare for a quintuple bypass. He’s seeing life from a different perspective. He told me last night, "I have great doctors, family and dear friends surrounding me, and all the sweet fans praying for me. I started to really think about my life and how I seriously want to make some major changes. The pain from some bad things that happened in my childhood have caused me to sabotage myself through low self-worth, anger, and poor health choices." He continued, "Because of my massive heart attack, the most positive things have happened. I’m finally beginning to feel my inner child’s pain and it’s causing me to have a change of heart!" ❤️ There is nothing better than learning life lessons from someone who is writing in their “book” right now. Going over to the hospital and listening to Kimmy—the teacher—has convinced me even more how we can all help each other be better. I’d like to share with you some of his wisdom this Sunday. Go to my Facebook page or my website marieosmond.com/sundaymessage to read these special words from Kimmy. 🙏🏼</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>Marie Osmond</a> (@marieosmond) on Feb 10, 2019 at 2:16pm PST</p><p>Marie thanked her fans for keeping her and Kimmy in their prayers. “To all of you who met and loved Kimmy over the years, thank you for the outpouring of prayers & messages during these difficult months. ❤️😘🙏 ￼,” she said.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Marie’s social media</a>, Kim was first hospitalized on January 21. In February, she announced that he suffered a “<a href=#>massive heart attack</a>” and had to undergo surgery, which involved putting stents into his heart to prepare for a quintuple bypass.</p><p>“He’s seeing life from a different perspective. He told me last night, ‘I have great doctors, family and dear friends surrounding me, and all the sweet fans praying for me,'” Marie wrote at the time. “One more thing Kim asked for me to share with all of you today is, ‘What I have learned and am most grateful for, is I have great friends. I love you all!!! I’m going to work very hard to get healthy and be there for all of you like you have been there for me.'”</p><p>Rest in peace, Kimmy.</p><p>Be sure to check out and <a href=#>subscribe to our Classic TV & Film Podcast</a> for interviews with your favorite stars!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mmKuhlWK8tLnOp5tmmpWowW6y0aKcp5xdoLauecaopp2vmaN6pbXEnWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-drew-lock-sister-claire-lock-wikipedia-age.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Drew Lock Sister Claire Lock?
