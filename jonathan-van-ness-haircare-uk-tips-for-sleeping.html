A paddle brush! A flat iron? I want my whole kit. But really, a good wide tooth comb, which is the most affordable. Everyone needs one of them to consistently distribute conditioner throughout hair in the shower. You can’t just apply conditioner with your fingers, you’ve got to use a wide tooth comb or wet brush to really pull it throughout your hair evenly in the shower.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1e26bf078b9e-comb-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eVuAcJmVU7p8 data-wc=5><strong>Caliwaves wide tooth comb, £7,99, <span><a aria-label=comb class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Amazon</a></span></strong></p><h6 dir=ltr style=text-align:center><span><a aria-label=comb class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><p id=eltdGEL3tJRi data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>How to repair damaged hair at home - everything you need to know</a></strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Do you have a top tip for keeping your hair looking great in the morning?

Put it into a loose top knot, because otherwise it gets stuck between your body and the pillow and rubs for eight hours a night – that’s not good. Gather your hair on top of your head and loosely twist it into a top bun and secure with a silk scrunchie. I emphasise the term “loosely” because you don’t want to put too much tension on the hair – that can cause breakage. Silk pillowcases are also really helpful and will set you up for success.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d3a9e7b73218-sofia-hair-wrap-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eL2Qb5ExjUb7 data-wc=4><strong>Sofia hair wrap, £45, <span><a aria-label="feel unique" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Feel Unique</a></span></strong></p><h6 dir=ltr style=text-align:center><span><a aria-label="feel unique" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><p id=ejSunAhDVn-0 data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Victoria Beckham's £5 secret to 'perfect' hair</a></strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>What inspired you to create JVN Hair?</h2><p id=euEoZoDs0NSf data-wc=65>Beauty is something that I have connected to my whole life. I grew up being very naturally interested in how hairstyles work and how to do my own hair. I wanted to understand ingredients and where they come from at a young age. My mom was really into natural hair care, so that gave me a really strong foundation in understanding where ingredients came from.&nbsp;</p><p id=e68kV3sg4_zM data-wc=72>After becoming a hairdresser and doing hair for 15 years behind the camera, in salon and in LA and New York, as well as so many different places, I’ve learned so much about what works, what doesn’t, and what clients need. When I started working in entertainment, I felt uniquely equipped with this message that I want everyone to celebrate their beauty for who they are and how they want to be.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezvWfgjR2PqE data-wc=59>Through haircare I think we can celebrate that beauty more readily. It took me years to figure out how I wanted it to come together and to find the right partner, because sustainability, inclusivity and ingredient quality was really important to me, so it’s taken a long time to build it. I’m so proud of how it’s come out.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/db0d7709ba56-jvn-hair-z.jpg><h6 dir=ltr style=text-align:center><span><a aria-label="jvn hair" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP JVN HAIR</a></span></h6><h2 dir=ltr>What was the journey to create JVN Hair like?</h2><p id=eylD6Z2k6Bfg data-wc=66>I was really lucky because Biossance is our sister company and I got to meet all the team of formulators and chemists who create their formulas. It was actually through them that I found hemisqualane, an ingredient that is also in a lot of Biossance products; it is basically a smaller version of squalane, their star molecule. Hemisqualane is in every single one of our products.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKgJAXeTU6oW data-wc=92>I was really clear from the get-go that I wanted to formulate for hair concern versus hair type, because we have to normalise all hair types. Ultimately, hair is hair is hair – it’s just that all different types of hair need, in my experience, one of three things: more moisture, more strength, or more volume and body. So that’s why I formulated our Nurture, Damage and Embody ranges, as well as Complete, our styling and treatment line. It really is a universal line that works for all hair types and textures.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e89bfc450c7d-jonathan-queer-eye-6-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ek-kKhWUDDF7 data-wc=8><strong>Jonathan Van Ness on Queer Eye season 6&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>The JVN Hair tagline is “Come As You Are” – why was it important that your brand served all forms of beauty?&nbsp;</h2><p id=ed4NJo3hcFKz data-wc=54>For so long the beauty industry has been the gatekeeper of how hair is “supposed” to look. You know, if you’re a male, your hair should look like this; if you’re a female, your hair should look like that. For a long time, it didn’t even acknowledge the existence of non-binary and trans people.</p><p id=e3W90UbVxe1T_ data-wc=18>There are also rigid beauty standards that have always been a hallmark of the beauty and fashion industries.</p><p id=eRyFppntwGKN data-wc=95>I wanted to encourage people to come as they are and celebrate themselves. If you love the way your hair texture is, let’s celebrate that; if you want to blow dry your hair a different texture, curl it or straighten it, let’s protect it and celebrate the amazing art of hair transformation. Let’s be really clear that no one’s worth or value is based on how they look – and for so long, the beauty industry, as a whole, has made people feel less than. I don’t ever want to make people feel less than.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/653db94b447b-jvn-hair-mask-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e_9z1bKztKK6 data-wc=6><strong>JVN Nurture Deep Moisture Mask, £21, <span><a aria-label="hair mask" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Spack NK</a></span></strong></p><h6 dir=ltr style=text-align:center><span><a aria-label="jvn hair" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><h2 dir=ltr>You have a track record of transforming how people look and feel for the better – do you think our hair is intrinsically linked with confidence?</h2><p id=exyYrqlm1juK3 data-wc=59>The relationship between person and hairdresser is a really deep and vulnerable one because you’re sitting down and forced to look at yourself in the presence of another person, for a long time in some cases. That’s an intimate experience – and it’s one that you don’t experience with a lot of people in your life, so it’s important.&nbsp;</p><p id=eyOf0NpEOnNVl data-wc=76>But do I think our hair is intrinsically linked to confidence? I think that it is, but I wish it wasn’t. I wish that we could celebrate, love and find beauty in each other, no matter what our hair looks like. I do, however, know that there’s a physical feeling when you know your hair looks good – and it’s not even about the look, it’s about the time you took to show up for yourself.&nbsp;</p><p id=eUqujJnxfqvLP data-wc=70>It’s about the fact you gave yourself a gorgeous whole-scalp massage in the shower; that you distributed the conditioner throughout your ends when you put the conditioner on. When you take that time to nurture your hair and give it the products that make it feel nourished and hydrated, it makes you feel good that you took the time for yourself to do that. That’s what it’s really all about.&nbsp;</p><p id=e7i-OEkBX5g3y data-wc=34><strong>Hair should be fun – that’s something we can all celebrate, but I don’t think it has to be linked to our self worth and value. We’ve got to be nicer to each other.</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Are there any rituals you recommend trying when using the JVN Hair?</h2><p id=eYtyzYg_nVcyA data-wc=90>I love using our hair mask in the bath and am also obsessed with our Pre-Wash Scalp Oil. If you have hair, a scalp, or you’re living and breathing [laughs], this scalp oil is going to be so good for you! The more you ask of your hair, the more you should be doing on your scalp, so if you have braids, extensions, up-dos, use a ton of product (like dry shampoo or hairspray) tight headbands or ponytails that put pressure on the scalp and hair follicles, you need this.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c0c0aa5b5553-jvn-hair-oil-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e5x7v-r18ZleU data-wc=5><strong>JVN Pre-Wash Scalp Oil, £24, <span><a aria-label="space nk" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Space NK</a></span></strong></p><h6 dir=ltr style=text-align:center><span><a aria-label="space nk" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><p id=efqOf6MElXdef data-wc=84>It has turmeric and rosemary leaf extract in it – the turmeric helps decongest the hair follicles, plus it also contains hemisqualane which is really reparative to heat-styled hair, as well as bisabolol, which is a powerful anti-breakage ingredient. In clinical trials, it was shown to reduce breakage by up to 93% after three months when used twice a week, which is major! You just apply it all over your scalp, massage it in for 15 minutes and then wash it out. It’s fabulous.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>What is your happiest hair moment?</h2><p id=etvDvjn1OHrkX data-wc=60>Oh my gosh, not to sound like a nightmare brat, but when your hair is this pretty every day, my whole life is a happy hair moment – I’m having one as we speak, I did stunning curls today.
