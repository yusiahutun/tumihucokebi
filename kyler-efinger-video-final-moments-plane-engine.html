His family said he had a history with mental health issues and believed he was going through a "manic phase" at the time of his death.</p><p>The footage, released by the Salt Lake City Department of Airports (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>FOX 13</strong></a>), shows the moments leading up to Efinger's death, following <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>an alleged "disturbance"</strong></a> at a shop in the airport after going through security. He had reportedly missed his flight to Denver to see his sick grandfather.</p><p>In the footage, Efinger is seen running up to an empty gate and attempting to open a locked door in the boarding area. Someone who appears to be on the custodial staff can be seen talking to him, before he then runs for another gate.</p><p>At the next gate, he also tries to open the locked door and falls to the ground doing so. He then bangs on the glass, throws both of his shoes at it before leaving the area. He then kicks open an emergency door and somehow makes his way to the airfield, where thermal imaging cameras catch him running toward a taxiing plane.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a85e5f17-8fc8-4530-9517-2fd995a94e63 data-container-ref=toofab:article:dc180ce1-11fd-48a7-a9e4-d87ba11149ae data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/62/5by4/2024/01/12/62243e3df7a144b9a830fdb7dbccae1a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">WROC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Video Footage Shows Man Who Later Died Being Kicked Out of Ambulance</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Authorities later found Efinger's clothes on the runway, before discovering him inside the engine of an Airbus A220-100. He was pronounced dead at the scene. "The aircraft's engines were rotating," said police, "The specific stage of engine operation remains under investigation."</p><p>Efinger's family said he had bipolar disorder and was "reluctant" to seek treatment, but appeared to be doing well when they saw him at Christmas shortly before the incident. His father, Judd Efinger, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>FOX 13</strong></a> his son "got held up in security" and missed his flight, before calling him.</p><p>"Those phone calls, I just knew it was coming on. They call it the manic phase," said Judd. "Those just don’t end well for him. Obviously, this one, the worst ever."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pmam1foMatsdFmnJ%2Bhnpyys3nVopuep12btq%2Bty2akqKWVo8G0ec%2BlmKedXZq7qLXNnmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rums-back-9-things-you-didnt-know-about-pirates-top.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rums back: 9 things you didnt know about the pirates top tipple</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./article-d4036912-9163-5a13-b09f-8c1b92de3e65-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jones County graduates from Mississippi State | Education</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
