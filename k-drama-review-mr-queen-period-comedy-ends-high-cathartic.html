Every once in a while, all the elements build to a cathartic and effortless conclusion. Mr. Queen did just that, wrapping things up with a bang in a finale that drew the fifth-highest audience in tvN’s history.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The mix of frothy body-swap comedy and period political intrigue occasionally came off as ungainly, but for the most part Shin Hye-sun’s barnstorming lead performance and the series’ fresh and flexible approach to genre kept viewers coming back for more <strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">–&nbsp;</strong>and the showrunners saved the best for last as King Cheol-jong (Kim Jung-hyun) and his queen stormed the palace in a climax bursting with suspense, slapstick and schadenfreude.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Throughout its 20 episode run, Mr. Queen has taken us on quite a journey. Thanks to its present-day opening and protagonist, once the show dragged us back 200 years into the Joseon Era, it forced us to view everything through a modern-day filter.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Through Bong-hwan’s (Choi Jin-hyuk) constant internal monologue and his anachronistic behaviour in the body of So-yong, customs generally presented in other period dramas as charming and traditional were lightly ribbed for being outmoded or conservative. The concept of Mr. Queen has provided a unique platform to engage with the social standards of present-day Korea, especially gender-based ones which are in the midst of breathless and very welcome change.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Mr. Queen midseason recap: subtle queer themes in period comedy</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The modern man in a period woman’s body ploy slyly introduced several observations on gender double standards, but Mr. Queen’s boldest gamble was its allusions to homosexuality. In the show’s early run, Bong-hwan was repulsed by his new body but as his consciousness started to meld with So-yong’s, he steadily began to drop his defences.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Several episodes closed with breathless close encounters as So-yong and King Cheol-jong’s lips held in the air a mere finger’s width apart, but after much prevaricating they eventually did lock in a tender embrace later in the season.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If that wasn’t enough, So-yong subsequently prepared a late-night ramen snack for the king. The ramen sleepover is universally understood as a booty call in Korea, but poor King Cheol-jong, not yet up to speed with 21st century innuendo, refuses the snack.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/02/16/ea0f24e8-5333-4ab7-b757-c75c4d85ae0f_abb1938f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nevertheless, this is soon followed by one of the show’s biggest reveals: So-yong’s pregnancy, which suggests that the pair’s relations didn’t stop at a kiss. Of course, given that physically this remains a heterosexual coupling, the most serious charge conservatives could possibly level at the show is a kind of spiritual homosexuality.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After being shot down in the palace courtyard on the cusp of victory, the spirit of Bong-hwan is finally returned to the present. He wakes up from his coma in a panic, and escapes police custody in search of a library to learn the fate of his dear king.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Naturally, happy endings are forthcoming as the king regains his throne, and the schemers that plotted his ruin are either jailed, shamed or exiled to the West Palace. Bong-hwan, meanwhile, discovers that his jaunt in history has also somehow altered his own trajectory, making him no longer a murder suspect, but a victim. He is elated to read that King Cheol-jong lived and prevailed, but as we leave him in the present, the show doesn’t go so far as to show him heartbroken.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Nine new Korean dramas to look out for in February 2021</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Back in the past, the real So-yong is definitely in love with the king, whereas she wasn’t before Bong-hwan entered her body. The combination of these endpoints for Bong-hwan and So-yong douses the show’s homosexual themes somewhat, but it’s unlikely that it could have ended any other way. That queer themes were explored within lead characters in a hit prime time series at all is a welcome progression for Korea’s traditionally conservative small-screen stories.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Twenty episodes is on the long side for modern K-dramas these days but Mr. Queen had plenty of things on the go that justified that running time, even if a lot of it had to be spent untangling the typically tedious palace scheming that Korean period dramas tend to mire themselves in.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Thankfully, the individual elements within the palace were generally able to pick up the slack left by the back room political interludes. The royal kitchen, run by the Royal Chef Man-bok (a hilarious Kim In-kwon) were always a delight, as was the amusing interplay between So-yong and her loyal servants, Court Lady Choi (Cha Chung-hwa) and Hong Yeon (Chae Seo-eun).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/02/16/a973c7fd-70aa-4a4e-b90d-d89b51ffaa63_fc6c3797.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ending on such a high, Mr. Queen may leave quite a vacuum, but tvN is aiming big with its time slot, which will next be occupied by the mafia-tinged legal drama Vincenzo, starring Song Joong-ki, which kicks off this weekend.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mr. Queen is streaming on Viu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLhuvM6pZqRllKeurq2OmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkGtocWxhZLhusNGapJploprDqrHWZqSrZaGqsqa6jKmcq6GfmXqku8yem7JllaOxtHnHop6hZZOWwamt0a2gnA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./royal-wedding-watch-party.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Royal Wedding Watch Party Ideas</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hong-kong-bound-jeff-koons-talks-plastic-art.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>From porn-star wifes nether regions to Balloon Dogs: Hong Kong-bound Jeff Koons talks plastic</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
