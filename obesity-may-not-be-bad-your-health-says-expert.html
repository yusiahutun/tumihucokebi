Changing diets, a growing dependence on processed foods, and modern conveniences have done away with the necessity for much physical exertion. This has resulted in rapidly expanding waistlines and a host of associated health complications: diabetes, heart disease, hypertension and joint damage, to name just a few.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A recent article in referred to obesity as "a catastrophic public health issue that threatens to cripple and bankrupt the medical system". You can hardly accuse governments of inaction: "fat taxes" are springing up in Europe, New York City recently banned large-sized sodas, and many cities have banned trans fats entirely.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aside from tax incentives and consumer restrictions, recognising being overweight as a preventable health problem is now a cultural consensus, taught in schools and driven home with anti-obesity public service announcements and education. Is this the kind of decisive action a dire health crisis demands?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dr Lucy Aphramor doesn't think so. A researcher at Coventry University and a dietitian with Atrium Health, which is a social enterprise of Britain's Department of Health, Aphramor thinks that in many ways, these measures are making the problem worse.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She believes the measures are often based on outright falsehoods, namely that science is decisive on the link between health and weight. She fears the focus on weight as a preventable health issue has created a society-sanctioned environment of discrimination in which people struggling with their weight are openly ridiculed and treated as second-class citizens under the erroneous cover of moral obligation or public good.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"It became apparent to me early on that the fixation on weight was harmful: patients weren't improving their health, and would become preoccupied with weight and food, which affected their moods and social lives," says Aphramor, who has worked with the National Health Service for more than 10 years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And these patients' emotional health wasn't the only thing being affected. "I read up about harmful effects of intentional weight loss on bone health, and the damage to heart health of yo-yo dieting."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She was at a loss. Like pretty much everybody else, she believed in the correlation between health and weight loss.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I'd been taught that you just help someone reduce calories and the weight comes off, but what I found was a whole heap of evidence showing it is not possible in the long term," Aphramor says. "Even when people kept to a reduced-calorie diet for nearly eight years, they didn't lose a significant amount of weight."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then she discovered Health at Every Size (HAES), a belief system and trans-disciplinary global movement that sets out to change the fundamental ways society and individuals approach the issues of weight and weight loss.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">HAES emphasises intuitive eating: listening to your body and eating when hungry, and pleasurable physical activity in conjunction with body acceptance and self-confidence building.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the abstract for a paper she wrote for the with Linda Bacon, a nutrition professor at the City College of San Francisco, Aphramor clearly set out the case for HAES.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Current guidelines recommend that 'overweight' and 'obese' individuals lose weight through engaging in lifestyle modification involving diet, exercise and other behavioural change," she wrote.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"But the majority of individuals are unable to maintain weight loss over the long term and do not achieve the putative benefits of improved morbidity and mortality ... This weight focus is not only ineffective at producing thinner, healthier bodies, but may also have unintended consequences ... reduced self-esteem, eating disorders, other reductions in health, and weight stigmatisation and discrimination."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Clinical trials showed a HAES approach resulted in greater improvement in both physical and psychological health, and healthier behaviour compared with traditional weight loss.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aphramor joined forces with Sharon Curtis, a computer scientist and self-described "fat activist", to found HAES UK. Its aim is to improve people's self-esteem and health, and push back against a perceived trend of weight-fixation in the health establishment, which HEAS considers dangerous.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Aphramor, the most important point to get across is perhaps the most radical: "Except at extremes of fatness and thinness, weight itself isn't strongly correlated to health. We need to remember that weight loss and health are not the same thing."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Through HAES UK, she hopes to get the government to change its approach to weight loss and health. "There is no evidence these [public anti-obesity] campaigns are effective. Instead, we see an increase in food preoccupation, weight discrimination and eating distress. In Singapore, for example, anti-obesity campaigns aimed at children did reduce their weight initially, but there was a huge surge in eating disorders in the children."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aphramor brought the teachings of HAES to Hong Kong in the summer, giving an introductory HAES workshop at the Police Officers' Club. She left convinced there was real demand for a new way of looking at weight in Hong Kong. She is planning to return in March to run another introductory class, and an intensive three-day version of Well Now, a course that she developed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Critics worry that HAES provides a justification for unhealthy choices. But Aphramor is unswayed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I'm worried that conventional weight management gives cover for professionals to continue doing something that has mainstream support, even though it is harmful," she says. "I'm worried people end up hating themselves and become so afraid of eating, they learn to distrust their bodies and are taught to ignore signals of hunger and fullness.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I'm worried about the huge emotional toll exacted by believing that you are not OK, and being told you're a second-class citizen. And I'm worried about how food dread and body dissatisfaction get passed on to children."</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Weight ... there's more</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLWmrcutn2iZoqm2pLjEaGhqaGdlhnV7zpucrKGkrnqurdhmpaisXZeybq7AnWSyp6WneqmxwKWroWWjlsa0ecSxp56qpA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-better-skin-co-mirakle-cream-review.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Under-The-Radar &amp;quot;Miracle&amp;quot; Moisturizer We Can't Get Enough Of</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./492090-how-find-amazon-package-a-steps.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to find out who sent you an Amazon package in a few steps</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
