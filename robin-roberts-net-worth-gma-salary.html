The <a href=#>Good Morning America</a> coanchor’s <a href=#>net worth</a> will truly blow you away! <strong>Keep scrolling to see how much money she makes.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>What Is Robin Roberts’ Net Worth?</h2><p>Robin has an estimated net worth of $55 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. The news reporter, who was born in Alabama but raised in Mississippi, is the youngest of four children. Robin’s parents, mom Lucimarian and dad Lawrence, welcomed her into the world on November 23, 1960.</p><p>For college, she attended Southeastern Louisiana University, playing basketball while there, and graduated cum laude in 1983 with a degree in communication. Early on, Robin took jobs at local news stations across the South before eventually making it to bigger markets in Nashville and Atlanta.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Did-Robin-Roberts-Quit-Good-Morning-America.jpg><p>Years later, in 1990, she joined ESPN as a sportscaster and, in 1995, began contributing to GMA. Robin, to her credit, balanced both jobs for quite some time, ultimately leaving the sports network behind. That’s because she was promoted to coanchor in 2005 alongside <a href=#><strong>Diane Sawyer</strong></a> — who was later replaced by <a href=#><strong>George Stephanopoulos</strong></a> in 2009.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b></p><h2>What Is Robin Roberts’ Salary?</h2><p>Given the fact that Robin has celebrated so many milestones at GMA, it should come as no surprise that she is making bank on the program. In fact, her salary for cohosting GMA is apparently $18 million per year.</p><p>Despite earning big bucks, however, the Alabama native briefly took a step back from her hosting gig in August 2021 for a much-needed vacation.</p><p>“See you in September @goodmorningamerica,” Robin captioned her Instagram post announcing she would be taking a few weeks off. In the clip, the <a href=#>Jeopardy!</a> host was seen sporting a chic black and tan minidress and singing along as the song “See You in September” by the Tempos played in the background. She then walked (and danced) off the set while waving and saying “bye” to the crew.</p><p>Robin — who has survived breast cancer and a bone marrow disease called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) — has been with massage therapist <a href=#><strong>Amber Laign</strong></a> since 2005, officially coming out as gay in 2013.</p><p>During their 15th anniversary in 2020, Amber shared a sweet message to commemorate the milestone.</p><p>“Having you by my side is a gift as we continue to navigate this thing called life. I drive you crazy … I know, which is why I love you even more to this day,” she wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> at the time. “You have the kindest heart and most beautiful soul than anyone I know.”</p><p>As for awards, Robin has amassed too many throughout her career to name. These include <a href=#>Emmys</a>, a Peabody, the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism and the Arthur Ashe Courage Award. She is also an inductee to the Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46rppuhnmK%2FsK7Eq6usZZ6awW7DzquroWWXoq5uv8ClmKuxXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-best-taylor-swift-songs-about-summer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The best Taylor Swift songs about summer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hong-kongs-mental-health-crisis-demands-attention-everyone.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Opinion | Hong Kongs mental health crisis demands the attention of everyone</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
