The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star was awarded the slab on the Boulevard after more than three decades in showbiz. For some movie fans, they couldn’t believe he hasn’t had a star yet on the famous strip that honors actors and actress from the past and present.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-macaulay-culkin-makes-fans-cry-with-his-humble-speech-but-his-voice-gets-tongues-wagging>Macaulay Culkin makes fans cry with his humble speech – but his voice gets tongues wagging</h2><p>A video shared onto <a href=#>TikTok</a> which showed him thanking his family, friends and fans went viral over the weekend.</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> can be seen tearing up as he looks at his wife gratefully for her support throughout his career.</p><p>Although the star has been seen in other features, including the <a href=#>TV</a> hit American Horror Story, for some viewers, it has been decades since they heard him talk.</p><p>They remember the sassy child who fights against two robbers who try to steal Christmas presents from wealthy neighborhoods while families are away on vacation.</p><p>The 43-year-old was celebrated by his on-screen mom from the <a href=#>movies</a>, Catherine O’Hara, as well his wife, Brenda Song, the Disney star who played London Tipton in The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.</p><p>Their two sons were also in attendance, Dakota, two years old, as well as baby Carson who was welcomed into the world in December last year.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-you-are-absolutely-everything>‘You are absolutely everything’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1815428033-1024x683.jpg><p>It’s easy to see why Macaulay Culkin’s voice got so choked up during his emotional speech.</p><p>He glanced over to his wife Brenda and said: “You are absolutely everything.

You’ve given me just all my purpose. You’ve given me family.”</p><p>He then joked to the 35-year-old: “And after the birth of our two boys, you’ve become one of my three favorite people.”</p><p>The Christmas movie star then ended his speech with an iconic line from his childhood movie.</p><p>“And in the spirit of the holiday season I just want to say Merry Christmas you filthy animals”, he said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-that-s-his-voice>‘That’s his voice’?</h2><p>Even though Macaulay Culkin’s speech caused some fans to tear up in the comments, others couldn’t help but not recognize what he sounded like.</p><p>As Macaulay Culkin’s voice in the Home Alone movies was deeper than how it sounds now, people find it strange how it’s changed with age.</p><p>One wrote: “Macaulay Culkin voice really sounds like that.”</p><p>A second penned: “Okay but why was Macaulay Culkin’s voice deeper as a child than as a full-grown man??”</p><p>Then a third added: “I was not expecting Macaulay Culkin’s voice to sound like that.”</p><p>Before a fourth wrote: “The face makes it sound off like, bruh come off that and give me your real voice.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2WBcLnAnJiupJGueqTBy6Sgp2Wjpa6zt9Jmq56Zoqh6uLXToWSgqpGpsqfBy2aqqZ2VmLVurtStZJ%2BZnqh6tbTIp6JmoJViwLDBzZ2qZrGfqruosdFmq6GZnmK1qr%2BMmp6eZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./morgan-wallen-donates-100000-to-chicago-students.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Morgan Wallen 'thrilled' to donate $100,000 to Chicago students as he returns to stage</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paige-hurd.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Paige Hurd dating?
