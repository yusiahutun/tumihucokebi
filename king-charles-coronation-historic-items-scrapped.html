As the royal household starts to tick off items from their never-ending to-do list, the team at is taking a closer look at some of the historica; coronation items that haven't made the cut. Billed as a "solemn religious" event, Charles' modernised coronation is expected to be a "reflection" of the monarch's role in today's society while being "rooted in longstanding traditions and pageantry".</p><p id=e8uNGU4UdNi data-wc=53>With that being said, the King has done away with a handful of outdated and - in some cases, controversial - items including coronation oil made using an ancient recipe, a sparkling diamond, an outdated outfit and a wedge of hefty gold. <strong>Keep scrolling</strong> to discover why these historic items have been axed…</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Ancient coronation traditions and rituals</figure><h2><strong>King Charles' coronation oil</strong></h2><p id=e6cPBqUry5Ll data-wc=51>In keeping with the times, King Charles' <a class=hm-link href=#>holy anointing oil</a> will be animal-cruelty free.

In lieu of the historic gem, Queen Camilla's coronation crown will be embellished with diamonds from the late Queen Elizabeth II's personal collection including the Cullinan III, IV and V.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/24554d3afe43-koh-i-noor-diamond-z.jpg><p id=e7J5hhbqhiko style=text-align:center data-wc=8><strong>The diamond will not feature in the coronation</strong></p><p id=eaDSagA-Hhgj data-wc=25>Weighing a hefty 21.12g, the Koh-i-noor diamond is one of the largest-cut diamonds in the world and is reportedly worth between <strong>$140million to $400 million.</strong></p><p id=ebeaFmeuIGX7 data-wc=36>It was seized by the East India Company after its victory in the Second Anglo-Sikh War of 1849, and was later given to Queen Victoria. The diamond has remained in the British Crown Jewels ever since.</p><p id=e13c3e3oMpjn data-wc=51>The giant sparkler was first set in a cross at the front of Queen Mary's crown when it was worn at her coronation in 1911. Nonetheless, it was later replaced by a replica in 1937 when the original was moved to the Queen Mother's crown for her and George VI's coronation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/798a3d49f5d3-diamond-crown-z.jpg><p id=eIF3fKAqgr6E style=text-align:center data-wc=4><strong>The Queen Mother's crown</strong></p><p id=evjImkl1fXAM data-wc=53>For the royal affair, Queen Camilla will don <a class=hm-link href=#>Queen Mary's spectacular silver crown</a> encrusted with 2,200 diamonds. This is the first time since the 18th Century that an existing crown will be used for the coronation of a Consort instead of a new commission being created, in the interests of sustainability and efficiency.</p><h2><strong>The traditional presentation of gold</strong></h2><p id=eOMPHT6YuCqM data-wc=63>King Charles' coronation is set to be <a class=hm-link href=#>much shorter than his mother's three-hour long service</a>. Although the religious ceremony will feature the six core elements based on the sections contained in the Second Recension used in 973 for King Edgar: The recognition, the oath, the anointing, the investiture, the enthronement, and the homage, Charles has reportedly scrapped a handful of other outdated traditions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0f093f105ec4-queen-coronation-balcony-z.jpg><p id=e0_SvfNq2Lhh style=text-align:center data-wc=7><strong>Queen Elizabeth II on her coronation day</strong></p><p id=eiwhvFyN2y1h data-wc=40>Amongst these is the traditional presentation of gold. During the Queen's 1953 ceremony, an ingot or wedge of gold was presented to her. In light of the cost-of-living crisis however, we anticipate that King Charles will ditch this extravagant ritual.</p><h2><strong>King Charles' coronation outfit</strong></h2><p id=equ_eMdPmxRj data-wc=28>In another break from tradition, His Majesty will reportedly wear his military outfit during his coronation in lieu of the traditional breeches and stockings worn by his predecessors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/150686b96b65-king-charles-robe-z.jpg><p id=e5CJ7RedU-Gw style=text-align:center data-wc=6><strong>King Charles will break with tradition</strong></p><p id=eMJLmNOdyxzI data-wc=25>If he does, this shakeup certainly adheres to the modernised coronation we've been promised and does well to reflect the monarch's role in today's society.</p><p id=eSjFQNROJScM data-wc=36>Despite steering clear of the breeches, King Charles is expected to wear several different sets of coronation robes.
