Jimmy Presnell and Jessica “Jess” Vestal met in The Pods but didn’t get engaged. Jimmy broke up with Jess in The Pods before he proposed and got engaged to his fiance, Chelsea Blackwell, who broke up with her ex, Trevor Sova, after her engagement to Jimmy.</p><p>Jess returned for the first time on Love Is Blind Season 6 in Episode 8 in which Jess revealed that Jimmy sent her a friend request on social media the day after he got back to Charlotte, North Carolina, following his couple’s trip with Chelsea. “Eight hours go by, and I go back and check, and he withdrew the friend request and put his profile on private. I was like, ‘I already saw what you looked like. You’re just mad because you can’t see what I look like now so you’re being petty. I’m like, ‘Oooh, you must be thinking of me,” he said. Jimmy, for his part, denied to Chelsea that he was attracted to Jess and told her that he thought she looked like a “Kardashian.”</p><p>Jimmy and Jess met in person for the first time in Episode 10 of Love Is Blind Season 6 when they both attended a party with the cast, including Chelsea and Trevor. The party came after Jimmy and Chelsea had several fights over Chelsea’s apparent “clinginess” toward him and Jimmy’s lack of affection toward Chelsea, though they were still together at the time of the party. “Seeing Jess and hearing her again, it’s tough. She left me with a lot of emotions. Jess is very good looking. I’m attracted to her,” Jimmy said in a confessional interview.</p><p>During their first conversation in person, Jimmy opened up about his issues with Chelsea to Jess. “We had our biggest fight,” Jimmy said. “It’s been a rollercoaster.” Jess responded, “I want you to be good to her. Not me being the one to give you advice. Don’t look at this as advice coming from an ex. Look at this as advice coming from one of her good friends.” Jimmy then asked Jess, “Are you an ex? I don’t know. I get nervous around you. I’ve never remotely dated anyone who’s like you personality-wise. I felt really pressured with you. You were basically saying, ‘I’m right here. I’m telling you how I feel. What else do you need to make you get on one knee?'”</p><p>Jess, however, denied Jimmy’s account. “No, that’s not what I said. I didn’t say, ‘What else do you need to get down on a knee?’ You read my letter out loud and then you were dead silent and when you were silent, that was so loud. You read it and I was like, ‘This is how I feel about you and all of my commitments to you. You are it for me. You are my person.’ And you were dead silent. How would anybody react to that?” She continued, “That night you told Chelsea that you loved her. I lost it. Oh my God, I cried more that night than I probably cried my whole life.”</p><p>The two seemed to end their conversation with closure and as friends, but that hasn’t stopped viewers from wondering whether Jimmy and Jess are together from Love Is Blind Season 6 in present day, especially given his drama with Chelsea. At time of writing, both Jess and Jimmy follow each other on Instagram, so they’re at least friends. Jess and Chelsea also follow each other. What makes it more interesting is that Jimmy and Chelsea also follow each other and have interacted a lot on social media, which means they’re either still together or at least on good terms.</p><p>Jimmy has liked several of Chelsea’s posts from December 2023 to February 2024 when Love Is Blind Season 6 premiered. Chelsea, for her part, has only liked one of Jimmy’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> posts from him in New York City in January 2024.</p><p>Chelsea’s posts that Jimmy has liked includes a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Christmas selfie</a> in December 2023 and two Love Is Blind Season 6 promotional posts in January and February 2024, including Chelsea’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>announcement</a> that she was on Love Is Blind Season 6. “It’s me, hi, I’m the problem, it’s me. Jk…tune in Feb 14th to find out! Only on Netflix! 💕 #loveisblind #netflix,” she captioned the post.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfn7auudhmoZ6ro2LAtbXLpWStp5eawamx0WajqK6VYra0ecGloKecXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./backstreet-boy-a-j-mclean-shows-off-hair-transplant.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Backstreet Boys Singer A.J.
