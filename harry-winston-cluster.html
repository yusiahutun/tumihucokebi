When he was just 12 years old, he spotted a green piece of glass amidst a tray of costume jewels in a pawnshop and promptly bought it for 25 cents. But as he rightly guessed, the stone was actually a two-carat emerald, and he re-sold two days later for the princely sum of $800. The rest, as they say, is history – and the Harry Winston name later went on to become synonymous with some of the rarest and most celebrated gems in history, as well as some of the most iconic jewellery designs still being worn today.</p><img alt="natalie portman" title="84th Annual Academy Awards - Arrivals" width=2237 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/actress-natalie-portman-arrives-at-the-84th-annual-academy-news-photo-1700568353.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Michael Buckner</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Natalie Portman wearing the Harry Winston Cluster at the 2012 Oscars</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Becoming the King of Diamonds</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">‘The King of Diamonds’, as one magazine editor dubbed Harry Winston in 1947, got his start at a young age. After following his family to Los Angeles, where they had reopened his father’s jewellery shop, Winston returned to New York and, in 1920, opened his first business, the Premier Diamond Company. Though just 24 years old, Winston quickly established a sterling reputation in the gem trade, buying up exquisite collections from auctions and estate sales and resetting their most beautiful stones into more contemporary settings.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Just twelve years later, amid increasing demand from his roster of high-profile clients, Winston founded his eponymous company and began selling pieces of his own design crafted in platinum. He also travelled the globe, buying and exhibiting headline-grabbing ‘legacy’ gemstones such as the 726-carat Jonker diamond, the Hope diamond (which was later rechristened the Taylor/Burton diamond, after Richard Burton purchased it for his then-wife, Elizabeth Taylor), and the Star of the East.</p><img alt="charlize theron" title="88th Annual Academy Awards - Red Carpet" width=4515 height=3010 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/actress-charlize-theron-attends-the-88th-annual-academy-news-photo-1700567036.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Christopher Polk</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Charlize Theron wearing the Harry Winston Cluster at the 2016 Academy Awards</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At the same time, Winston cemented his claim to being ‘the jeweller to the stars’, and revolutionised the course of red-carpet dressing, by being the first to lend diamonds to an actress to wear to the Academy Awards – he dressed Jennifer Jones in 1944, when she scooped the gong for Best Actress for her role as a sickly teenager in The Song of Bernadette. Between the 1950s and 1970s, Winston’s boutique became a magnet for luminaries such as Claudette Colbert, Shirley Temple, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and The Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who bought several jewels for their personal collection including a 31.26 cushion-shaped stone that once belonged to the American socialite, Evalyn Walsh McLean.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">By 1952, Life Magazine would report that Winston had amassed the world’s second largest collection of historic jewels – with the largest being owned by the British royal family. The following year, the King of Diamond’s name would be forever immortalised on the big screen when Marilyn Monroe sang ‘Diamonds are a Girl’s Best Friend’ in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.</p><img alt="julie andrews" title="73rd Annual Academy Awards - Arrivals" width=1292 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/julie-andrews-arrives-at-the-73rd-annual-academy-awards-at-news-photo-1700567641.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kevin Winter</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Julie Andrews wearing the Harry Winston Cluster at the 2001 Academy Awards</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">The Winston Cluster Comes to Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Harry Winston wasn’t simply a diamond enthusiast – he was also a creative spirit with an incurable romantic streak. One chilly December evening in the 1940s, as he approached his home in Scarsdale, Winston noticed the leaves of the holly wreath on his front door glistening with frost and was transfixed by the design they formed, with the rest of their branches seeming to disappear into the background. It occurred to him that his diamonds ought to dictate their settings, with minimal use of metal, and the concept of ‘clustering’ was born.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Under his supervision, Winston’s in-house team, including head designer Nevdon Koumrouyan, drafted a design with pear and marquise-cut diamonds laid at differing angles to each other, held by near-invisible prong settings to enhance their brilliance and sparkle from every direction. Three quarters of a century later, this timeless, sculptural formation is considered a signature house technique, with vibrant stones like sapphires, emeralds and rubies often added into the mix.</p><img alt="jennifer lopez" title="Jennifer Lopez and Ralph Fiennes On Location for &amp;quot;Maid in Manhattan&amp;quot;- Kissing Scene" width=2214 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jennifer-lopez-during-jennifer-lopez-and-ralph-fiennes-on-news-photo-1700566839.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">James Devaney</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Jennifer Lopez wearing the Harry Winston Cluster in ’Maid in Manhattan’</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">An A-list Favourite</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Today, the Harry Winston Cluster remains one of the maison’s most sought-after motifs, especially amongst celebrity clients, as the setting never fails to deliver a dazzling, photo-ready sparkle.</p><img alt="gwyneth paltrow" title="Gwyneth Paltrow" width=689 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gwyneth-paltrow-news-photo-1700566711.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kurt Krieger - Corbis</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Gwyneth Paltrow wearing the Harry Winston Cluster for her Oscars win, 1999</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jennifer Lopez, Kerry Washington, Natalie Portman, Julie Andrews and Charlize Theron have all worn Winston clusters for red-carpet appearances. In 1999, Gwyneth Paltrow famously won the Best Actress Oscar for her role in Shakespeare in Love wearing Harry Winston cluster diamonds that she was lent for the occasion. After the event, Paltrow’s father, Bruce, bought her the pieces and presented them to her as a surprise. She wore them again at her 2018 wedding to Brad Falchuk as a way to remember her father, who sadly died in 2002, “as a way of keeping him there with us.”</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Harper's Bazaar Women of the Year Awards 2023" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/omh23044-bazaar-woty23-3576-enhanced-nr-654ba0aa4b16d.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmS3psPEpaOeqqlixKLAwqGcrGeRaYJ6fJNqa3FnmJa%2Fs8WMsKCnq6Sku26vy66qrZ2iZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./whos-richest-red-hot-chili-peppers-net-worths-ranked-how.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Whos richest of the Red Hot Chili Peppers?
