Born out of the need to connect to people more, the sector has now fully transformed into something else. It is an addiction for some people, and it is a way to make a living for the big chunk of its users.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Influencers, aka the people who make a living out of social media, have been sharing their lives with us, shaping our preferences, and influencing us in many ways we can’t even count. So when an influencer decides to leave social media, it is usually for a short amount of time. I consider these “breaks”, as their annual vacation leaves from their jobs; even though some of them haven’t come back yet. But today, let’s check out the influencers who teased about leaving, but couldn’t stand not posting.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>YouTubers Who Quit But Then Came Back</h2><h3><strong>1. Jake Paul</strong></h3><p></p><p><span>Starting the list with the most obvious and scandalous name: Jake Paul. After receiving backlash on his not so family friendly videos, he announced leaving YouTube quite a few times over the year but always came back. At this point, his quitting videos have become his regular content to be honest.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><strong>2. Jaclyn Hill</strong></h3><p><span>The OG beauty guru has been under fire for some time with her product launches and videos. Accused of only posting on YouTube to promote a product, Jaclyn took to Snapchat to mention she wanted to leave the platform because it had become toxic for her. Even though she didn’t release a video stating this, you could understand where she stands with the platform by checking the timeline of her channel.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><strong>3. James Charles&nbsp;</strong></h3><p></p><p><span>Known for his apology videos rather than makeup looks, James has taken a lot of breaks on the platform in the last 2 years. His last apology video, where he accepts the accusations didn’t perform very well though. So who knows when he will be back in the studio.</span></p><p><span>If you want to read what went down with James Charles over the years,<span> <a href=# rel=noopener>read our article here.</a></span></span></p><h3><strong>4. Shane Dawson</strong></h3><p><span>We all know Shane, we all watched at least one of his hundreds of videos. He is one of the OGs on YouTube. He was doing extremely well until he got involved in the Dramageddon of 2019. His last work, the documentary of Jeffree Star’s life and his palettes with Morphe were also loved but when his past surfaced on Twitter, he got cancelled. Ever since then, he has been testing the waters to see if he can come back. However, everytime he teases, he gets backlash again, as the audience doesn’t seem like they want him back on the platform.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>5. The One Who Didn’t Come Back, But Everyone Wants Her To:</b></h3><h3>Jenna Marbles</h3><p></p><p><span>Jenna Marbles. The OG YouTuber that helped shape the platform to what it is today, still hasn’t come back. She left YouTube because she realized she had done wrong things in her past, even though nobody called out on her. Jenna still wanted to take accountability, and leave the platform for an unknown amount of time. She might also be one of the rare YouTubers that the audience wants to see again, so fingers crossed she comes back soon.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>What do you think of the YouTubers who have recently quit? Is there anyone you can’t wait to see again, or is everyone expendable on the fast paced platform?
