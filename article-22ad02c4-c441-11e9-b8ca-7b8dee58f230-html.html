While Reliance (aka Laurel Industrial Garment Factory) changed names several times throughout the years, when she retired it was GK Team Wear. She loved her work and loved the people she worked with and missed them dearly when she retired. She once said, that after her retirement, she missed it so much that she dreamed almost every night that she was back there working.</span></p><p><span>She was a lifelong member of the Big Creek Missionary Baptist Church in Soso. In her retirement years, she enjoyed helping in the kitchen or in the nursery during their Vacation Bible School.</span></p><p><span>She loved spending time with her family both in Soso and Leland. She especially loved her two great-granddaughters, they both brought much joy to her and she looked forward to meeting her soon to be adopted great-grandson.</span></p><p><span>She is preceded in death by her husband; her parents; her son-in-law Billy Harris McDonnieal; her sister Kiprell Shows Collins; and her brother James Kever Shows.</span></p><p><span>She is survived by her daughter Marsha Katrina Smith McDonnieal of Leland; two grandchildren, Jai Derek McDonnieal (Shane) of Royal Oak, Mich. and Breta Elisabeth McDonnieal Ray (Shelton “PJ”) of Avon; and three great-grandchildren, Molli Grace Ray, Zoie Elisabeth Ray, both of Avon, and Gavin Harris McDonnieal of Royal Oak.
