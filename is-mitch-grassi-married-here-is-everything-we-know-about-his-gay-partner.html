The triple Grammy countertenor singer has been professionally active since 1992 when he was only ten years old. Over the years, he has co-founded two major music groups: the 5-piece band Pentatonix and the musical/comedy duo Superfruit, which he founded together with his Pentatonix colleague Scott Hoying.</p><p>Mitch chose Scott from all the other members of his Cappella group to form Superfruit, obviously because he got along better with him than with the rest. It has also become public knowledge that there is much more than just music between the two friends. This article, therefore, offers you the opportunity to learn more details about them and especially about Scott.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who Is Omari Hardwick? How Long Has He Been Married to Jennifer Pfautch?</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Are The Music Stars Married?</strong></h2><p>It is no longer just a rumor that Mitch Grassi and Scott have a homosexual relationship. So let’s not pretend that we don’t know. The chemistry between the two is so strong that you compare them strongly to old couples who are still in love. This fact also became clear in an interview with Billboard Magazine, in which they revealed how well they knew every bit about each other, from favorite colors to animals to movies, what the other would typically order in a restaurant, and much more.</p><p>Apart from the chemistry between the duo, it is well known to the public that they have long since come out of the closet. In 2017, for example, LGBT magazine OUT included both Mitch’s name and Scott’s name in its 2017 list OUT100, which lists activists in the LGBTQ+ community. Inclusion in the list was in recognition of many of their music publications that deal with gay issues and have a reputation for helping parents accept their gay children all the more. And well before the OUT100 list, the couple was already called the sweet gay members of Pentatonix, which they never denied.</p><p>So the gay relationship of Mitch Grassi to Scott is no secret. What remains a mystery for many is the question of whether they are married. Many people are confused about this because Mitch has called Scott his husband by himself. So many of their fans have wondered whether they got married secretly some time ago. On this point, our results so far show that they are not married. Instead, they like to play with these words just to keep things light.</p><p>Sometimes they even have a video called “Are we dating? But while everyone expected that they would answer the question, in the end, they could not be reached. So we have the feeling that they just want to make fun of their relationship status. Watch the video below so that you can make up your mind about the matter.</p><p></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How Mitch Grassi and Scott Met For The First Time and Connected To Eachother</strong></h2><p>During the aforementioned billboard interview, Mitch and Scott revealed a lot of details about themselves. One of these details concerned their first encounter, which took place in Arlington, Texas, where they both grew up. They were about ten years old and playing together for the first time. Their connection was instantaneous as they discovered that they had many things in common, such as their shared interest in music and acting. They also shared the same sense of humor.</p><p>However, they soon lost contact with each other because they were attending different schools. Then they found each other again after about eighteen months and it was like heaven. From there they began to build their careers together, and now the rest is history.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Jana Kramer Husband, Age, Height, Feet and Body Measurements</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Scott Hoying’s Background</strong></h2><p>He was born as Scott Richard Hoying on 17 September 1991 about 10 months before the birth of Mitch Grassi on 24 July 1992.
