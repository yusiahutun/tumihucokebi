Taking place every 28 days, it brings your attention to profound “turning points” in our lives, relaying information that was previously unknown to us. And if you’re one of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>zodiac signs most affected by the full moon</a>, it could show you something that could change literally everything you thought you knew.</p><p>What is a “full moon”, exactly? This is when the moon—ruler of your internal self—forms an opposition with the sun—ruler of your external self—creating inner turmoil and tension that forces you to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>make a change</a>, no matter how small or drastic it may be. This is the phase of the lunar cycle that is always marked by twists and turns, excavating deep truths from the most shadowy crevices of your mind. Pent-up emotions may rise at the most unexpected moment, as major epiphanies run rampant when the moon is at its fullest state.</p><p>On January 25, a <a href=#>full moon in Leo</a> will reach its peak at 12:54 p.m. ET. Leo—the fixed water of boldness, creativity, romance, self-expression, enthusiasm, royalty, and main character energy—is urging us to be brave enough to take up space. It’s time to step into the spotlight and wear our hearts on our sleeve without apology. Opposing the sun in systemic, idealistic, community-oriented, eccentric, <a href=#>and </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>idiosyncratic</a><a href=#> Aquarius</a>, this full moon wants you to find balance between the “I” and the “we”, as well as the desire to be seen and the grace to allow someone else to have their time in the sun. At its core, the Leo-Aquarius axis is about passion vs. rationality, as well as pleasure vs. moderation. While Leo is focused on putting on the greatest one-man show, Aquarius is more concerned about making sure everyone is acknowledged. While Leo is concerned with having a great time, Aquarius is concerned with what the “good times” are distracting us from.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-17.png><p>This particular full moon is extra fascinating, marked both by emotional intensity as well as stabilizing realizations. The full moon in Leo is squaring off with <a href=#>abundant Jupiter</a><a href=#>in Taurus</a>, leading to an explosion of creative inspiration and romantic inclinations. However, let’s not forget it’s also opposing <a href=#>Pluto—planet of creation and </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">destruction</a>—which just recently entered Aquarius. Pluto always brings things to an extreme, and with Pluto at play here, the artistic measures we’re taking and the desires we’re feeling in our relationships could carry a dangerous undertone.</p><p>However, Leo is also ruled by the sun, which happens to be in Aquarius. And in traditional astrology, Aquarius is ruled by <a href=#>Saturn, which is </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>currently</a><a href=#> in Pisces</a>. And with Saturn forming a sextile with Venus in Capricorn, as well as Jupiter in Taurus, there could be a grounding and practical force that prevents us all from getting too carried away. It’s just as important to be responsible and realistic as it is to dream big.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=these-4-zodiac-signs-will-feel-the-full-moon-most>These 4 Zodiac Signs Will Feel the Full Moon Most</h2><p>If your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>sun sign</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>moon sign</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a> falls under any of the following the upcoming full moon will bring you to the end of a journey, leaving you with revelations and rewards. Here’s why these zodiac signs will feel particularly rocked by it:</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9229208924949><h2>Taurus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zodiacbanner_taurus.png><p>Pay attention to what’s happening behind closed doors, Taurus. This full moon is showing you deeper truths regarding your home and family dynamics, as well as your relationship with your ancestral roots. Do you feel as though there are conflicts with family members that need addressing? Does your home environment truly feel welcoming? Are there early childhood memories you can learn from (or heal from)? This full moon is here to remind you that in order to blossom the way you deserve to, you must regularly water your roots and nourish your personal life. No accolades or public recognition will matter—or truly last—without something solid and heartfelt to hold it all in place. Remember—there’s not just one sole definition of home, because home is what it means to you and what you make of it. You can’t change where you come from, but you can change your perspective of it. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.4075><h2>Leo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zodiacbanner_leo.png><p>Get ready to make a major splash, Leo. Something important in your life is coming to a head, whether it’s a major change or a significant revelation regarding all the ways you’ve grown, evolved, and even backtracked. With the full moon rising in your own zodiac sign—and activating your first house of the self—you’re the main character of this story and you have the power to be your own hero rather than wait for someone to save you. There are so many things about yourself that you’re just beginning to realize or coming to terms with. Even a Leo who wants to be in the spotlight has a tendency to hide the aspects of themselves they don’t believe people want to see. Now, it’s time to shine your light on all aspects of your humanity. As this full moon opposes Pluto in Aquarius, the world is ready to get to know a new side of you; a side that you’ve been keeping secret for far too long. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.8625812441968><h2>Scorpio</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zodiacbanner_scorpio.png><p>Your career is taking off in a new and exciting way, Scorpio. As this full moon blasts through the night sky, it could arrive with promotions, accolades, and perhaps even a change of course. Taking place in your 10th house of public image and professional pursuits, this full moon is making damn sure that you are on everyone’s mind. Get ready for the world to become aware of the strides you’ve been making, especially as it pertains to your biggest goals. This full moon brings your attention to what really matters to you in your career and the way you market your success. You want to be noticed for the right things, so make sure you’re allowing those things to be seen. If you’ve been feeling bored with your work, this full moon may remind you that it’s time to make the preparations necessary to quit your dead-end job and start. If you’ve been working hard toward the dreams that are super important to you, this full moon could arrive with some exciting results. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.2756529850746><h2>Aquarius</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zodiacbanner_aquarius.png><p>The partnerships that define your life are beginning to change, Aquarius. As much as you may want a certain relationship to work out, keep in mind that you can’t control what another person says, does, or thinks. And under this full moon, you may become aware of someone else’s actions and intentions (and whether they truly have your best interest at heart). Activating your seventh house of partnerships, this full moon brings truth to light in your one-on-one relationships, showing you your enemies, your allies, and what you need to do in order to attract relationships that align with your values. If conflict has been burning up, this full moon could highlight tensions, giving you a chance to remedy the situation, communicate with each other, and work on finding a solution together.
