In fact, our romance began in a gym! Fitness has had a positive effect on our relationship because it is a common interest that we both feel very passionate about. We work out together, and that allows us to spend much more quality time together.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>A father of three from his previous relationships, his would-be wife, Katy, complemented Shannon’s children, Kaley, Kayla, and Kiara, significantly. With the easy-go nature of Shannon's girlfriend, she brought balance to his aggressive and trash-talking personality.</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, it seems time has taken its turns on Shannon and possible wife, Katy, and their relationship. The former lovebirds have definitely decided to pursue their separate paths in life after Katy became pregnant with her new partner Marlon Byrd. A fitness instructor himself, it isn't too hard to imagine how Katy and Marlon's attraction initiated.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=color:#0000cd></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Shannon's supposed wife, Katy Kellner, was&nbsp;pregnant with her new boyfriend, Marlon.

His lack of a dating life has made him the subject of several gay rumors. His dating history, though, makes it abundantly evident that he is not gay. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-631 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Nevertheless, making it big in life after coming from a background where most struggle for mere subsistence, Shannon has not forgotten the contribution of his family members in making him the man he is just yet.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Shannon Sharpe's Family Sacrifices Not Yet Forgotten</h2><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-186 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>After achieving three super bowls rings in his career duration, a ring considered by many to be the greatest prize in sports, nobody would have blamed Shannon had he let fame get over his head and changed his lifestyle.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Don't Miss:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Married High School Girlfriend, Then to a Famous Publicist: Skip Bayless' Married life, Wife.

Talking about his grandmother, who passed away the same year, he reminisced his final words towards a woman to who he owes all his success. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-629 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>“I asked her, ‘Are you proud?’ I said, ‘Granny, are you proud of your baby? Because everything I’ve done in my life, I’ve tried to please you.’”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Shannon, like his grandmother, remains ever-so-grateful to his former footballer brother Sterling Sharpe.</p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Shannon Sharpe hugged his brother Sterling during his hall of fame induction in 2011.

My place in the game was made that day. No one can take away that championship. As I hoisted the Lombardi Trophy I knew the time had come to give back. I won three Super Bowls in my career, but the first was the most special. It wasn’t my victory alone. It was Sterling’s as well. So I gave him my ring.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Shannon, age 54, besides being a loving son and a brother, also remains a proud father to his kids. He displayed just how important his son and daughters are to him after mentioning how he will utilize his NFL pensions in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a>&nbsp;on 24 July 2017.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-native_bottom"></span><p style=text-align:justify>“My pension is for my kids. I've got a lot of responsibilities I take care of Mom, sister, kids, my own household.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>He never misses an opportunity to express his gratitude to his mother, sister, brother, son, and daughters for being the backbone of his life.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-native_bottom"></span><p style=text-align:justify>So while the NFL great now continues to entertain Fox Sports&nbsp;viewers with his show alongside Skip Bayless, it would be safe to assume that Shannon has not forgotten his responsibilities towards his family just yet.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Stay <a href=# rel=follow>tuned</a>&nbsp;with us to get more updates on&nbsp;Shannon Sharpe.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqygkaO7sLqMrJ%2BaqqCaeq6t0augnpxdrLansYycn6KklKeyr3rHraSl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./liev-schreiber-naomi-watts-split.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Liev Schreiber &amp;amp; Naomi Watts Split After 11 Years Together</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./18-facts-about-river.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>18 Facts About River - Facts.net</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
