Despite already breaking up with Abbey, he explained that Izzy coming back into the house to shoot her shot again with “boss ass energy” won him over. “We picked up from where we left off,” Bartise told Netflix’s cameras. “She opened herself up. She’s a super attractive girl, I can tell she’s attracted to me. And I’m curious to see what we can turn this current relationship into.”</p><p>That also meant that their final date was also their first real date, so Bartise and Izzy had a lot of ground to cover, including future plans, timelines for kids, and their dating history. Though Izzy noted that they’d had “a bit of a rocky road” since he already left her for <a href=# class=T3D>Ines Tazi</a>, the 22-year-old Too Hot to Handle alum was willing to give their budding relationship a fair chance. Their biggest challenge? Bartise, 26, lives in Dallas, Texas, and Izzy lives in Manchester, and neither of them has ever been in a long-distance relationship on an international scale.</p><p>“I would be willing to come to the UK and see what we can turn this really into and see what it can become,” Bartise promised her, later telling his Netflix castmates and host Nick Lachey that he “might make a trip across the pond soon.” Still, Bartise and Izzy were on the same page that it was far too premature to declare themselves a “perfect match,” and they were the only pair of the final five couples to admit as much.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Courtesy of Netflix</p></figure><p>Before the final cast vote, Ines said that she thought Bartise and Izzy made a good couple. Abbey, on the other hand, had a different take. “Bartise, 30 minutes before he decided to match with Izzy, was telling me he wanted to end the night with me,” she revealed to the group. “It’s been 24 hours. You’re gonna tell me your narrative changed? I don’t see how you switch up so quickly because I’m not that kind of person.”</p><p>Abbey’s prediction that Bartise and Izzy wouldn’t still be together after Perfect Match seems to be correct — and the production timeline might have provided the biggest clues. The <a href=# class=T3D>Love Is Blind reunion</a> and <a href=# class=T3D>After the Altar filmed</a> in early fall 2022, about six months after Bartise already <a href=# class=T3D>shot Perfect Match</a> in March. During both specials, Bartise claimed to be single, while still exploring lingering feelings with Love Is Blind ex-fiancée Nancy Rodriguez, who eventually told him once and for all that she didn’t even want to be friends with him anymore.</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Bartise’s Instagram</a> posts also seem to support the theory that he’s single. Aside from a lack of evidence he ever made that trip “across the pond,” some other recent examples include him joking in December that he has “<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>tons of free time</a>” to workout because “no b*tches” were pursuing him. The same month, he also made light of all of <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>his red flags</a> and that he and Perfect Match castmate <a href=# class=T3D>Zay Wilson</a> <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>can’t </a><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>not</a><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> be toxic</a> in relationships. Around the same time, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Izzy also posted</a> a social media caption, encouraging her followers, “Don’t waste your time on anyone but you.”</p><p>Still, Bartise and Izzy appeared to be on good terms well over six months after ending their Perfect Match journey together. They spent time in Los Angeles promoting the new series in early 2023 and also follow each other on Instagram. In November, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Bartise commented</a> on one of her photos with flame emojis, writing, “atta girl izzzzz,” to which she replied, “hello you” with a red heart emoji.</p><p>Though they don’t seem to be together, only time will tell if Bartise or Izzy is dating someone else.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZpqqlWKvor7IrKueZZmvx7p50q2gpaRdqbyosdOhnKtlkZvBpr6MqZyrnpWYwW65wK2aoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hocus-pocus-2-everything-we-know.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hocus Pocus 2: Everything We Know</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./actress-sofia-hublitz-dating-anyone-right-now-or-enjoying-a-secret-relationship-see-her-affairs.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Actress Sofia Hublitz Dating anyone right now or enjoying a secret Relationship; See her Affairs</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
