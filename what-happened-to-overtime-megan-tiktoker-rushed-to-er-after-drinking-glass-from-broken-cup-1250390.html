Megan claimed she drank from a broken&nbsp;glass while she was hanging out with the NELK Boys, a well-known YouTube prankster group, and she later ingested some of the glass. <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>She added a caption&nbsp;to a picture of her wearing a wristband while sitting in a hospital, and wrote, “Ended up in the ER because the glass I drank from was broken…Legit drank glass.” Fortunately, Megan asserted that everything was OK. She wrote, "Doctor said I should be okay, but whew."</p><p>She then responded to several questions in the comments, stating that she was hospitalized for only about an hour and a half and that she is currently doing well.
