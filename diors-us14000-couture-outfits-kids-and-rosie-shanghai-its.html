According to Euromonitor, a market research provider, the market for luxury childrenswear has grown steadily for the last five years, with the Asia-Pacific region market alone worth more than US$1.2 billion in 2018.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For me it was a very big discovery. When I arrived at Dior I saw how big the market is in China and it was a joy for me to see this, because the way they buy and put things together is completely different and they have a very good eye and are fashion forward,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Very quickly a lot of my little clients from Asia became my inspirations and I do have a muse who’s Chinese and she’s my favourite couture client. Her name is Rosie and she’s coming for her fitting this week.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unlike ready-to-wear creations that you can purchase off the rack at any stores, couture outfits are custom made and require a series of fittings before the final products are delivered.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Little girls love doing the fittings, but we have to do them quite quickly and we play music and give them treats and they enjoy the experience so it’s a real fitting like for adult clients, and the little girls are so excited,” says de Castellane.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A veteran of houses such as Chanel and Ungaro, de Castellane, who is the cousin of Dior Joaillerie’s designer Victoire de Castellane, once had her own childrenswear label; she joined Baby Dior in 2012.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While the creative aspect of fashion design is the same for children and grown-ups, that’s where the similarities end, she says. “It’s much more difficult to design for children because you have a lot of technical and safety issues,” de Castellane explains.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You can’t put buttons or ribbons in certain places and there are many other limitations, so when I give my drawings to the atelier sometimes they say that they can’t do it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The fabrics are also special and the clothes have to be comfortable because kids are not going to wear something just because it’s beautiful. It has to be practical. The fabrics cannot be itchy. You can have the most beautiful dress but if it’s scratches it’s useless.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You also have to think of how kids take their clothes off, especially for little babies, and so many things that you don’t want to think about when you design.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As a mother of four, de Castellane is aware that Baby Dior is not for everyone. “I want people, even those who can’t afford Baby Dior, which is more than 95 per cent of the world, to see the French savoir faire and the ateliers and what we do,” she says.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">We want to keep little girls little girls because you don’t want them to dress like womenCordelia de Castellane, Baby Dior</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Even I couldn’t afford Baby Dior for my children because it’s very luxury, but I want everybody to look at the pieces and enjoy them and dream and feel an emotion like when they go to a museum or see a nice show or film.”</p>While de Castellane works closely with Dior Men’s designer <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Kim Jones</span></a> on the boys’ range, she tries to keep girls’ clothes separate from the women’s line. “I don’t think it’s appropriate for little girls to look like their mothers,” she says.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There’s a lot of tulle in the women’s collection, so I use that and things like the same materials, but we want to keep little girls little girls because you don’t want them to dress like women.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An avid user of Instagram, where she likes to show off her creations, de Castellane says she’s not comfortable with parents documenting every moment of their children’s lives on social media, and has one precious piece of advice for young mothers and fathers trying to figure out how to make their children look best.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Don’t use your kids as dolls,” she says. “If you do that, in 20 years they will make you pay for it. Children are not toys and you have to respect them when you dress them.”</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: couture looks FOR PRECIOUS LITTLE GIRLS</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlkpqutsDYaJirrJmYuaZ7kmlpaXFlaXyltc6rqmato2aBcXyPZpqoraSqv6Z5zq6rn6GkqHqstcOsZJqmlGK%2FsL%2FInmSsoJGjtKmtyGagras%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./paige-hathaway-age-husband-boyfriend-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Paige Hathaway Husband, Boyfriend, Baby</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./20-surprising-facts-about-emmanuelle-seigner.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>20 Surprising Facts About Emmanuelle Seigner</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
