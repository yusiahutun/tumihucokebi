Read on for what we know about Alex Hall’s secret boyfriend and whether they’re still together.</p><p>Alexandra Hall, also known as just “Hall,” is a cast member on Selling The OC, Netflix’s reality TV series following the personal and professional lives of real estate agents at the luxury brokerage, The Oppenheim Group, in Orange County, California. Hall is one of several original cast members on the series, which is a spin-off of Netflix’s Selling Sunset, along with Polly Brindle, Kayla Cardona, Sean Palmieri, Gio Helou, Alexandra Jarvis, Brandi Marshall, Alexandra Rose, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/why-tyler-stanaland-brittany-snow-divorce/>Tyler Stanaland</a>, and Austin Victoria.</p><p>Much of Hall’s time on Selling The OC has revolved around her dating life and flirtmance with her co-star and friend, Tyler Stanaland, who divorced his wife, actress Brittany Snow, following Season 1 of the reality TV series. Tyler addressed claims that he cheated on Brittany with Hall in an interview on “Reality Life With Kate Casey” podcast in 2022. “We’re all really tight friends,” he said. “There’s a respect; no lines will ever be crossed. Most of us are married or dating somebody, so there is kind of a set boundary there.” He continued, “It’s just a funny thing to do, and we’re a very tactile, touchy-feely group. It’s nothing sexual.”</p><p>While Hall and Tyler never officially got together, they explored a situationship in Seasons 2 and 3 of Selling The OC. Season 3 also saw Hall date a secret boyfriend, who took her everywhere from London to Italy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-s-alex-hall-s-boyfriend>Who’s Alex Hall’s boyfriend?</h2><p>So who is <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/tyler-stanaland-alex-hall-still-together-selling-oc/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Alex Hall’s boyfriend</a> and are they still together? Read on for a timeline of Hall’s relationships throughout Selling The OC and what we know about her secret boyfriend.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=18.437884722999><h2>TikTok Businessman</h2><p>Alex Hall dated who she claimed was a Global Marketing Director for Tiktok in Season 3 of Selling The OC. Hall never revealed who her boyfriend was, however, from what she told viewers, he’s from London and works for TikTok. He also took Hall to Las Vegas for a trip after Tyle invited (and later uninvited) her from a vacation to Nashville. “Honestly? He’s a catch,” Hall told Tyler about her boyfriend in the Season 3 finale, revealing that she planned to go to Italy with him for 10 days, the longest time she’d ever been away from her children. “On paper, I literally couldn’t create him if I wanted to. It’s perfect.”</p><p>While Hall never revealed her boyfriend, she did confirm to <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.bustle.com/entertainment/alex-hall-selling-the-oc-season-3-interview rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bustle</a> in May 2024 that she and the TikTok businessman are no longer together. “He’s a very private person. He’s pursuing his career and dreams in London. As a working single mum, my priorities are here. So, unfortunately, that became unrealistic,” she said.</p><p>Hall also confirmed her split from the businessman in an interview with Us Weekly at the time, where she also explained why she dated the marketing director over Tyler. “Girls got to eat. I was only getting breadcrumbs and I needed a big full loaf of bread, so I went to Italy,” she said</p><p>She continued, “We only dated for three months when he was here, and half of that time was not exclusive. We tried doing the long distance thing and eventually it just got to a point where it was unrealistic. He didn’t know when he was coming back and I needed, again, some more answers and more security, a timeline. I just really feel like I need to focus on what’s here and my priorities here. So, we’re still friends. Very, very, very good friends. He’s a great guy, but I need someone here.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=20.942439470078><h2>Tyler Stanaland</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Tyler-Stanaland-Alex-Hall-2.jpg><p>Though Alex Hall and Tyler Stanaland never officially dated, they did have a flirtmance throughout Seasons 2 and 3 of Selling The OC following Tyler’s divorce from his wife, actress Brittany Snow. Alex and Tyler’s relationship became romantic in the Selling The OC season 2 finale, where they kissed for the first time.</p><p>“I think we’re still navigating our friendship. Obviously, you see in Season 2 [that] we explore some things. It leads to a steamy moment and I think we’re still kind of trying to figure it out, but we remain really close friends and I don’t have an answer [on where we stand] for you at the moment,” Tyler said at told Us Weekly in September 2023 of his romance with Hall. Hall, for her part, teased that fans will “have to stick around [for] Season 3” to see what happened to her and Tyler’s relationship after their kiss.</p><p>She continued, “You see throughout season 2 the dynamic of our friendship, and it’s easy and it’s comfortable because there it is, just that. It’s a friendship. There’s no strings attached and I think adding that other element is scary. … Some things are awkward, you know what I mean? And you can’t avoid it. So we’re just navigating.”</p><p>Selling The OC Season 3 saw Tyler and Hall attempt to pursue a relationship, however, after several miscommunications and mixed messages on Tyler’s part, Hall rejected Tyler and chose to pursue her relationship with a TikTok Global Marketing Director instead. Hall confirmed in an interview with <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://people.com/selling-the-oc-star-alex-hall-confirms-she-and-tyler-stanaland-still-don-t-speak-8642796#:~:text=During%20the%20interview%2C%20Hall%20disclosed,%2C%20and%20what's%20going%20on%3F%E2%80%9D" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a> in May 2024 that she and Tyler do not speak.</p><p>“We don’t speak. I’ve accepted it at this point,” she said. “In the beginning, it was kind of confusing, and what’s going on?” She continued, “There were some revelations that surfaced right after we finished filming season 3, and so it gave me a lot more clarity and understanding of why he was behaving certain ways, and I was really able to have closure, because I could wrap my head around it. That’s not to say that it wasn’t shocking and confusing and hurtful, but it did give me clarity as to why he was behaving a certain way the entire season.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Neil Flores</h2><p>Alex Hall’s ex-husband is a man named Neil Flores, who she was married to for seven years and shares two children with: a daughter named Gia and a son whose name is not publicly known, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.romper.com/entertainment/selling-the-oc-cast-members-who-have-kids-photos#:~:text=Alex%20Hall%20is%20a%20mom%20of%20two.&text=Hall%20shares%20both%20children%20with,married%20to%20for%20seven%20years.">Romper</a>.
