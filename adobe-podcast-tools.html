It fits with an overall vision that Adobe supports the creative endeavors of people. I‚Äôve requested access but haven‚Äôt gotten it yet, so I haven‚Äôt played with the complete product yet.</p><p>There are two free tools that anyone can use in the Beta, though:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/chriscoyier.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-23-at-12.38.28-PM.png><p>Enhance speech allows you to upload an MP3 or WAV and it‚Äôll fix it up for you (1 hour / 1 GB max). The results are pretty badass ü§Ø:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The other is Mic Check, which has you say a single sentence into your microphone (‚ÄúHow is my microphone setup and placement?‚Äù) and lets you know how it sounds. It‚Äôs apparently trained on ‚Äúthousands of hours‚Äù of audio tests. Here‚Äôs how the results look:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/chriscoyier.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-23-at-12.40.40-PM.png><p>Mic Check is a tremendous idea. It‚Äôs best to get the best quality you can up-front rather than have to manipulate it later. This might be creepy, but I think I‚Äôd like to see a product like this running all the time, say as a menu bar app. I would get a warning when any of the checks are bad.</p><p>Dave has mentioned this to me several times over the years on ShopTalk: there should be a quick way to check if you‚Äôre audio is correct. The right source, the right gain, no weird sounds coming through, etc. This is the closest I‚Äôve seen.</p><p>It looks like the complete tool will integrate these things, but be much more, like an actual recording studio. Sounds like you invite people and record together ala <a href=#>Riverside</a> or <a href=#>Zencastr</a>, but it‚Äôs doing more, like transcribing the audio (including who is talking when which is wild) as soon as it uploads. Also: fancy cleaning up of audio (as seen above, and automatic removals of uhmmms and ahhhhs) which means they get to call it ‚ÄúAI-Powered‚Äù and get their AI merit badge.</p><p>The editor looks very innovative, allowing you to drag in audio clips to splice in, in between people talking or in the background. Also: editing the text itself to edit the audio (like if you remove a word in the transcript, it plucks it out of the audio). There seems to be a whole category of tools that can do that lately, but it feels more like a feature than an app, so it‚Äôs nice to see it part of a larger whole.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/chriscoyier.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-23-at-12.34.19-PM.png><p>I welcome a new generation of high-quality audio production and editing tools!</p><p>Here‚Äôs a related thing I think about. <strong>Where is the best place to do audio manipulation?</strong> I think there is a big distinction between <strong>live audio</strong> and audio that is <strong>only recorded</strong> for later editing. When audio is live (on the radio! a concert! a zoom call!), it makes sense to do whatever you can to make sure it sounds good right away.</p><p>We had a ShopTalk Show guest warn us they were using <a href=#>Krisp</a> to fix up audio while on the call. It made me wonder‚Ä¶ is that good to be doing right now? Or should we be getting the audio more raw so it can be manipulated later? It kinda felt like Krisp is good for live audio but perhaps not right for recorded audio. You can always apply manipulation later, but if it‚Äôs recorded manipulated up-front, you can‚Äôt undo that.</p><p>I also used to have a <strong>dbx 286s</strong>, which I was told was awesome for podcasting at the time. It would do stuff like de-ess sound, help with background noise, prevent peaks, and whatnot. But it was audio technical debt. If the sound was live, that would make sense, but it was one more thing messing with the audio that was intended to be edited later. If the dbx settings were off, they couldn‚Äôt be fixed in post. So I have since stopped using it, as anything it could do could also be done in editing.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibmKe2tK%2FOsqCeql6jsrV7kWlpbGdgZ3xzf46am6ialWK9sLDCmqqtZaSkvK2%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./businesses-remain-open-while-moline-flood-cleanup-continues.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Businesses remain open while Moline flood cleanup continues</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./48-facts-about-iain-armitage.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>48 Facts about Iain Armitage</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
