This, say Diabetes UK, is wrong. "There is no such thing as mild diabetes,"&nbsp;says the charity. "All diabetes is serious and if not properly controlled it can lead to serious complications such as amputation, kidney failure, blindness and stroke." Diane Abbott MP knows just how tough the condition can be – it caused the shadow home secretary to step down from campaigning before the&nbsp;general election – at the time citing 'ill health'&nbsp;– after a series of criticised interviews.</p><p id=eaK4bx9xgfFA data-wc=7>EMBED START Image { id: "embedded2.31264505" }</p><p style=text-align:center id=ePzKwp6BNzwy data-wc=10><strong>Diane Abbott had to step down from campaigning (Yui Mok/PA)</strong></p><p id=ej5GMdeY-AiU data-wc=7>EMBED END Image { id: "embedded2.31264505" }</p><p id=ejaahUQ3fQHt data-wc=68>It's apt then that in Diabetes Week (June 11 -17), Abbott&nbsp;has spoken out about the problems she was having during the intense seven-week election campaign. In an interview with the , she revealed&nbsp;she’d been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes two years ago and said: "During the election campaign, everything went crazy – and the diabetes was out of control, the blood sugar was out of control."</p><p id=enTz8DZ-Wvas><a class=hm-link href=#>STORY: The symptoms and signs of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes</a></p><h3><strong>How did Type 2 diabetes affect Diane Abbott?</strong></h3><p id=eRxn0zZ1DIpa data-wc=106>Type 2 diabetes happens when people don't produce enough insulin, (a hormone made by the pancreas which tells the body's tissues to absorb glucose from the blood), or the insulin they produce doesn't work properly. This means the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood is too high, as the body’s not using it properly for energy. However, Kathryn Kirchner, Diabetes UK's clinical advisor, says: "Some medications for diabetes, and insulin, can cause blood sugar levels to go too low, below 4mmol/L. This is called hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia must be treated immediately by taking quick-acting glucose, often in the form of glucose tablets, non-diet drinks or sweets."</p><p id=eea1NUjTnN5k data-wc=3>EMBED START Twitter</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Twitter</a><p id=ezP69AwIka1G data-wc=3>EMBED END Twitter</p><p id=eBXQq-cnH9Ty data-wc=80>In Abbott's case, she said she hadn't eaten enough food to get her through numerous back-to-back interviews, which had affected her performance. Not eating enough would have put her at risk of&nbsp;hypoglycaemia, which can cause dizziness and confusion. Her brother saw her&nbsp;interview with LBC's Nick Ferrari, when she struggled with police funding figures, and, she told , berated her: "He knew it was my blood sugar and gave me a lecture about eating and having glucose tablets."</p><p id=eI760XySPlfv data-wc=55>Abbott added: "It is a condition you can manage. I am doing that now and I feel ready to get back to work." Indeed, as Kirchner says, "Having diabetes is not a barrier to holding down a job or juggling family life. We talk to many people living with diabetes who are testament to this."</p><h3><strong>How bad can&nbsp;Type 2 diabetes get?</strong></h3><p id=eH6N0sPZ3HxC data-wc=7>EMBED START Image { id: "embedded4012" }</p><p style=text-align:center id=eEqUgWFXe1cA data-wc=12><strong>Diabetes occurs when the glucose in your blood is too high (Thinkstock/PA)</strong></p><p id=eNYlcTIx-v7o data-wc=7>EMBED END Image { id: "embedded4012" }</p><p id=ecEVXfesBcbc data-wc=53>"Diabetes is the fastest growing health threat today," says Kirchner. "We know that 3.6 million people have been diagnosed with diabetes and around 11.9 million adults are at increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, but don't even know it.&nbsp;Its impact and complications can be devastating, causing blindness, amputations, even early death."</p><p id=epOGNVX3Kt1O><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: See the latest health features here</a></p><p id=eKwOcV57p0Ot data-wc=53>Short-term complications can include hypoglycaemia (blood glucose dropping too low) hyperglycaemia&nbsp; (blood glucose rising too high) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) – when low levels of insulin cause harmful ketones to build up in the body, which can be life-threatening.&nbsp;Long-term complications include how diabetes affects your eyes, heart, kidneys, and nerves and feet.</p><h3><strong>How do you avoid the serious complications&nbsp;of Type 2 diabetes?</strong></h3><p id=eNAANGDAaoaP data-wc=7>EMBED START Image { id: "embedded4016" }</p><p style=text-align:center id=ePUUWF1ykCVu data-wc=10><strong>Exercise and eating healthily are important for managing diabetes (Thinkstock/PA)</strong></p><p id=eg8sjDG8BsQh data-wc=7>EMBED END Image { id: "embedded4016" }</p><p id=e9UGB257BFYK data-wc=127>Kirchner says: "Type 2 diabetes is treated with a healthy diet and increased physical activity. Medication and/or insulin is often required too. One of the biggest risk factors for Type 2 is being overweight. Age, ethnicity and family history can also have an impact.&nbsp;Three out of five cases of Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed if people take action, to maintain a healthy weight, eat well and be active. Following a healthy diet and exercising regularly are really important for managing all types of diabetes, as well as preventing Type 2 diabetes. Making these lifestyle changes, as well as taking medications as prescribed helps to manage blood sugar, blood fat and blood pressure levels, which will reduce the risk of diabetes complications,"&nbsp;says Kirchner.</p><p id=e_EcPvh7jgoe data-wc=56>Getting the right health checks is vital too: "They show you how your diabetes is progressing, help to spot signs of complications as early as possible and identify changes to help prevent complications.&nbsp; Diabetes UK's 15 Healthcare essentials will help anyone living with diabetes to see they are getting the checks and tests, which can help."</p><p id=exvxHrECI0zk data-wc=14><strong>If you're worried about being at risk of diabetes, always speak to your GP.</strong></p><p id=efJuCl3MMeRX data-wc=3>TRACKING START GA</p><p id=e7Q1XTbgSIoL data-wc=3>TRACKING END GA</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
