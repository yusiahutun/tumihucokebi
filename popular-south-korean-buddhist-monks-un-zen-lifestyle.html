It has sold over four million copies and topped Amazon UK‘s list of bestselling books in 2017, according to the Korea Joongang daily.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He published his second book, Love for Imperfect Things, in 2016, which topped the bestseller list in South Korea, and has also been operating a counselling centre. In addition, he launched a start-up that develops mobile apps for meditation last year.</p>But controversy erupted after he recently appeared on a TVN entertainment show called On & Off, which follows <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">people in the public eye</span></a> at home and at work.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In an episode that aired earlier this month, Haemin wakes up in a relatively spacious, US$800,000 two-storey house with commanding views of Mount Namsan in central Seoul, uses expensive mobile devices and flaunts his own mobile meditation app before heading off to his app-development company to work.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Singapore arrests 21 members of South Korean cult church</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rumours have it that he also drives a Ferrari and owns a building in central Seoul. All of this from a supposed Zen monk leading an austere life whose line from his bestselling book, True giving is done without expecting anything in return, has become widely cited in South Korea and elsewhere.</p>One of the most severe attacks on Haemin’s character came from Krokodile Choi, the popular lead singer of heavy metal band Victim Mentality whose <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">YouTube</span></a> videos excoriating what he sees as Haemin’s hypocrisy went viral.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He is the greediest person that I’ve ever known,” Choi said on his YouTube channel. “He is making money by ripping off those who are emotionally hurt with sugarcoated words that are far from supportive.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hyon Gak, an American monk who was ordained in South Korea but now practices Zen in the US, joined the fray, calling Haemin a “parasite”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He is merely an actor … a parasite who will end up in hell for selling Buddha‘s teachings for profits,” he wrote on his Facebook page.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Samsung patriarch’s death spurs calls to reform South Korea’s chaebol</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the two monks later reconciled after a phone call that Hyon Gak said was “full of love and mutual respect and profound gratitude for one another”. Hyon Gak then praised Haemin as “an unbelievably beautiful human being with great sincerity” on his Facebook page. “We are both passionately committed to the same thing: practising Dharma.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Internet users have continued to heap ridicule on Haemin, though. “Anyone can say nice things about controlling the mind, but what is important is to implement them. While posing as a monk, you are accumulating your private wealth”, a post said in Korean.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another post said: “Buddhist monks tell others not to be greedy but they themselves are all out making money. That‘s why they are being criticised as hypocrites.”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">He is merely an actor … a parasite who will end up in hell for selling Buddha‘s teachings for profitsHyon Gak, American monk</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Haemin has also reportedly never taken part in a three-month reclusive meditation session in his dozen years as a monk – something that is normally expected of them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chang Yong-jin, a journalist who has long covered Buddhism in South Korea, said that there were other Buddhist monks in the country who were much richer than Haemin, but that Haemin was getting more criticism because he has passed himself off as pure and become a celebrity while the other monks largely remained out of the public eye.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“People thought Haemin would be different from them and they were all the more disappointed when he turned out be no exception,” he said on a radio news show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/11/18/ef63a366-2982-11eb-bf26-f2b76f37a526_1320x770_194743.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like most of Korean Buddhist monks, both Haemin and Hyon Gak were ordained by the country‘s biggest denomination, the Jogye Order, which has long been dogged by corruption allegations and factional feuds. Its former executive head, Seoljeong, was forced to step down in 2018 amid allegations that he had forged his academic credentials, accumulated vast wealth and broke his vows of celibacy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1994, the Jogye Temple in central Seoul saw rival factions of monks clash violently over control over the order‘s executive posts, leaving many monks and riot police injured.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A 2015 survey showed of the country‘s 51 million population, the number of South Koreans who identified as Buddhist stood at 7.6 million, down 30 per cent from 10 years earlier. Protestants totalled 9.7 million people, followed by Catholics at 3.9 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZLmqssSsq7KklWKwtrjTrqmeZ5Gnwaqvy55mbGlhZYB6gI6ppqmtnJa%2Fbr%2FOrquhZZukv6atzWaZrpyUnba0wIympqejo2LCr3nZnqVmpJmbsrTA2KWc</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-eagles-band-members-homes-houses-mansions-estates-pictures.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>See Inside the Spectacular Homes of the Eagles</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./teen-killed-sports-editor-father-2014-moved-friends-eight-bedroom-house-drug-parties-sentenced-30-years-prison-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Maggie Valley teen Crystal Brooke Howell who killed her father sentenced to 30 years</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
