His success as a white man in an area dominated by black artists makes him all the more remarkable. Before we discuss Eminem’s height, weight, and other measurements, here are some interesting facts about him that make him stand out from his peers:</p><p>He has won 15 Grammy Awards including Album of The Year he has sold over 172 million albums worldwide and he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2020. These accomplishments demonstrate why Eminem is considered one of today’s best rappers.</p><p>He was born Marshall Bruce Mathers III was born on October 17, 1972 in Deborah R. Nelson Mathers and Marshall Bruce Mathers. The star’s name comes from her initials Marshall Mathers (MM).</p><p>He had a hard life as a white and skinny child growing up in a predominantly black neighborhood he was beaten regularly and once he was beaten he was in a coma for a week. Long before he dreamed of becoming the very popular Slim Shady the star wanted to become a comic strip designer.</p><p>He may not be the most fashionable artist right now but when he makes people listen to music… a lot. The rapper had two of his top five best-selling albums in 2000 The Eminem Show was the top-selling album in 2002 and his album Recovery was the top-selling album in the world in 2010.</p><p>Eminem became a father at the age of 23 to his daughter Hailie whose mother Kim Scott was his high school girlfriend.

The star is not so high at 5 feet 8 inches which is well below the average height of American males which is 5 feet 10 inches.</p><p>Sources who have seen the rapper in person and even people who have not seen him up close would not agree. They think it’s a few centimeters smaller but what’s new? It’s even better occasionally the star claims to be 5 feet 9 inches long but most people think it’s not an inch above 5 feet 7 some even go as low as 5 feet 6 inches.</p><p>Whether he is 5 feet 6 7 8 or 9 we all have to admit that his talent is equal to that of a basketball player.

The coating of Vicodin and Valium I had been taking for years left a hole in my stomach so to avoid stomach aches I was constantly eating – and eating badly.</p><p>According to the International Business Times after almost dying of an accidental methadone overdose in late 2007 the rapper decided to wean himself off. How did he manage to achieve his amazing weight loss? He decided to replace one addiction with a less dangerous one.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Kanye West Height, Weight, Age, Body Measurements</a></strong></p><p>Eminem was running seventeen miles a day on a treadmill – eight and a half miles in the morning before leaving and eight and a half miles after his return.
