They were in a relationship since 2003 and kept the romantic journey till 2009.</p><p>Sadly they are no longer a couple anymore. It is heard that the pair broke up over a disagreement about whether to get married or not.</p><h2>Jodi and John Break Up</h2><p>After being in a relationship for a long time, it’s natural for couples to think about their future. Jodi did the same. She was in love with Cusack for six years and&nbsp;expected that their relationship would find a new meaning. Jodi Lyn O'Keefe wanted to be married to her boyfriend and settled down.</p><p></p><p><strong>Jodi Lyn O'Keefe sharing coffee with her ex-boyfriend John Cusack (2004) </strong>(Photo Credit: healthyceleb.com)</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-191 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>But things didn't go as planned.&nbsp;What she expected from John couldn’t be fulfilled. John couldn’t support her for this next step in their relationship. John didn’t seem ready to take the big leap and didn’t seem to be&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">in the mood for marriage</a>.</p><p>When they were dating, she hoped that he would change his mind about marriage, but when he couldn’t do so, she finally decided to call it quits for good.&nbsp;</p><p>Before the split, the two also took a Florida beach vacation to try if things would work out for them. But a witness says that once they returned from their vacation, “they were freezing to each other, bickering.” So, the vacation didn’t prove to be a success for both of them.</p><p>Previously, she dated Don Johnson in 1997 and also had a relationship with Jaime Gonzales in the year 1998. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-192 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Is&nbsp;Jodi Lyn O'Keefe Married?</h2><p>After she broke up with John Cusack, it seemed like her trust in relationships had blown away.</p><p>But it looks like we were wrong about that. As per her Instagram post, Jodi Lyn O'Keefe has found a partner for herself. She is in a relationship with a man named Douglas Little.</p><p>The big news came to light when both of them shared the same picture on Valentine's Day on their respective Instagram handle.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>While Jodi Lyn's caption read, Happy Love Day, Douglas, on his post, wrote:&nbsp;The key to my lock and the butter to my bread. Happy Love Day.</p><p>Going through her Instagram, it suggested that they are together since 2016&nbsp;as she had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> a post with him in late 2016.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-193 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>On the other side, Douglas also shares pictures on his Insta handle and doesn't shy away from flaunting his love for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For the time being, the couple is enjoying each other's company as boyfriend and girlfriend. And hopefully, in the near future, they would step up their relationship and get married.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Net Worth Of Jodi Lyn O’Keefe</h2><p>Besides being a hot actress and earning from Hollywood, she has other ventures too.
