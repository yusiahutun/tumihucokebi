However, in 1948 they surprised fans when they got married on live radio.&nbsp;Although fans knew that they got married in that fashion, no one knew why they took that step.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/5a/e2/af/5ae2af94a9473e0011d28520e62ba07b.jpg><p>However, in 2016 the comedian decided to reveal the secrets behind the radio wedding.&nbsp;According to Van Dyke, he and his wife Margie Willett had no money for a wedding.&nbsp;He <a href=#>noted</a>:</p><p><strong>“We were too broke to get married.

At that time, war was happening in Europe, and his family had moved far away from the war.&nbsp;Van Dyke’s 18th birthday was coming up, making him eligible for the draft. However, he wanted to avoid infantry and instead join the Air Force.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/4e/52/8d/4e528de02d22d960e14c9c065b573dda.jpg><p>The actor, who weighed six feet one inch and 130 pounds, decided to share his thoughts with his mother. Then, while she was washing the dishes, he <a href=#>declared</a>:</p><p><strong>“I’m going to be eighteen in March, that means I’ll be up for the draft. I really don’t want to go — and I really don’t want to be in the infantry. So I’m thinking that I ought to join now and try to get in the Air Force.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>His mother waited until she finished the dishes before telling him a secret they had hidden from him. Then, to Van Dyke’s shock, his mother disclosed he was already 18.&nbsp;</p><p>She revealed they kept the information from him because he was born prematurely. Also, there were some complications with his birth, which was why they pushed his birthdate forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, Van Dyke was unsatisfied with her explanation, so he went to his paternal grandmother for more information. Finally, however, he received the shock of his life when his granny <a href=#>said</a>:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“You weren’t premature. You were conceived out of wedlock.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>She further explained that his mother had gotten pregnant before she and his father got married. So, although nobody admitted it, Van Dyke’s birth was probably why they got married.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=He_Wrote_a_Book_on_Aging></span><strong>He Wrote a Book on Aging</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2015 Van Dyke released his memoir <a href=#>titled</a> “Keep Moving.” In the book, the comedian noted the secrets of staying healthy close to his 90th birthday in the book.
