"Little Hank's already seen the nude magazines. He's already seen them! He's cool."</p><p>It seems being naked is just a part of life in the Baskett house.</p><p>"He sees me naked every day. I have no shame. We take baths together. We take showers together. If you hide something then it becomes more taboo," she says. "Of course I would let little Hank see my Playboy."</p><p>While Kendra is clearly comfortable being in the buff with her kids, she quickly clarifies her statement. "I do wear a bathing suit in the bath with him, but I don't mind going in and changing in front of him," she declares. "A body is a body; it's not taboo anymore. I'm so glad we're breaking through those walls."</p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a1/o/2016/03/10/a1277cb1acd351b08ee49c264188cc32_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p>The <strong>"Kendra On Top"</strong> star is now married with two kids, but she says her time at the Playboy Mansion seems like yesterday.</p><p>"I can't believe <strong>[Hugh Hefner]</strong> is already turning 90. I met him at his 78th birthday party," she explains. "That's when I met him. That's when I moved in. It's amazing how fast time flies."</p><p>"I was one of the lucky people who got to know him and his heart, and a lot of people just know him through the media," she adds. "I was one of the lucky people who got to know him."</p><p>Kendra also opens about about her feud with <strong>Holly Madison</strong>. While the reality star admits that she was "pissed" when Holly's memoir came out, she's moved past it.</p><p>"At the end of the day, it comes down to regret. That's what it came down to," she says. "Everybody saw it clearly. Everybody knew that Holly wanted to be where she was at the mansion. Years later, she obviously regrets what she did."</p><p>"I'm all about trusting your story, not regretting. All it's going to do is erase those years of your life," she adds. "Holly being attached to anything Playboy or 'Girls Next Door' related is irrelevant now. She never wanted to be there, right?"</p><p>It looks like this feud is far from over!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnd7j2xmamhfoLKvsNGaZLChnKC2r7%2FOp2Ssp55itaK6ymahq2WelrimsIypo5qxkqTGbrzHqKuoq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meaning-of-alone-together-by-the-strokes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meaning of Alone, Together by The Strokes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mexico-mum-protects-son-down-syndrome-hungry-bear-devours-boys-birthday-meal-tacos-enchiladas.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>In Mexico, a mum protects son with Down syndrome from hungry bear that devours boys birthday meal</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
