In fact, the reality alum, who also starred on <a href=#><strong>Real Housewives: Ultimate Girls Trip</strong></a> says she's making way more money now on <a href=#><strong>OnlyFans</strong></a>.</p><p>While dropping by Sofia Franklyn's <a href=#><strong>Sofia with an F</strong></a> podcast last week, McSweeney said she's "making a s--t-ton of money, which is awesome." After initial hesitation about the platform, the 41 year old says she's embraced its freedom.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3aeb5280-012f-4c34-a67d-4b2146a2cfe2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:02b1d274-58c1-440d-b5d8-c61b4af056f8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8f/5by4/2024/02/08/8f79e59bf04341b88517e534f44462e1_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Brandi Glanville Says Caroline Manzo Sexual Assault Lawsuit Cost Her Job, OnlyFans 'Saved My Life'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I f--king love OnlyFans," she told Franklyn. "This is a wonderful platform where people aren't censored. They don't have ads in their face constantly. They don't have negative algorithms pushing bulls--t. I feel supported. I'm making money. I get to express myself. It's fun. I love it. I'm being creative on it. It's dope."</p><p>Despite how she's come to embrace the possibility of the platform, where McSweeney says she gets to be sexy and funny, the reailty alum was worried about how people might respond to her joining what many consider to be a sex and nudity site.</p><p>Like many celebs, though, McSweeney isn't doing full nudity on the site. "People thought my booty hole was on it, and it wasn't," she said. "They're like, 'Leah's selling pictures of her butthole for five dollars' I laughed at that so hard, though, because it's not true."</p><p>At the same time, she did concede, "It's sexy. Sometimes you see a boob -- or two! -- oh my god! But it's also funny."</p><p>Through OnlyFans, McSweeney also connected with former Sopranos star <a href=#><strong>Drea de Matteo</strong></a>, who recently opened up about her own shift to the platform after she claims her anti-vax stances and views cost her acting work.

Well, she didn't pull out her bank statement or anything, but she did say, "One week is more than one season," referring to her two-year stint on RHONY and follow-up on RHUGT just last year.</p><p>McSweeney also talked about her ongoing lawsuit against NBCUniversal, Bravo, and <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> in which she says Housewives producers took advantage of her alcoholism. When asked if she blames the show for a relapse, McSweeney said "blame" wasn't the right word.</p><p>"Let's change the way things are done and protect people that you're making a s--t ton of money off of," she replied. "Because I think that I should have the same rights when I walk into that work environment as, like, somebody who walks into any work environment has."</p><p>As reported in February, McSweeney filed suit against the show's producers, including Andy Cohen -- as well as Bravo, NBC Universal Media and more -- for allegedly creating a toxic work environment that exploited her mental health and alcohol use disorder in the "name of selling drama."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d520d5b7-0b12-4bce-9b14-51121babf61f data-container-ref=toofab:article:02b1d274-58c1-440d-b5d8-c61b4af056f8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b4/5by4/2024/02/28/b4c89c9af51c4dc48108b7f9cc515419_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Brandi Glanville Supports Leah McSweeney's Suit Against Andy Cohen: 'We Are NOT Expendable'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>A rep for Andy Cohen told <a href=#><strong>TMZ</strong></a> at the time that McSweeney's claims, which included him using cocaine with other Bravo stars, "are completely false."</p><p>Cohen had a lot more to say earlier this month in a letter sent directly to McSweeney in which he demanded, per ET, that she retract the cocaine allegation and stated that "virtually every" allegation she made was "categorically false."</p><p>She was accused of using litigation to "create fake news" and "to spread false and malicious lies, in furtherance of a shakedown."</p><p>McSweeney's representation responded with a statement of their own, claiming that it's "hardly surprising" Cohen wrote a letter that was received by the press. She argues he "is accustomed to using his power in the media to scare and intimidate," arguing that if he wants to address the claims, "we suggest he do so in court, not in a letter for the press."</p><a id=gallery-link-17b47595-d4ef-4bbd-9540-12b93f128e7b class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:17b47595-d4ef-4bbd-9540-12b93f128e7b data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:02b1d274-58c1-440d-b5d8-c61b4af056f8 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f1/4by3/2024/04/01/f1bdd6fc3db74d26a03476fd3763e052_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2xmbGlfobKitIymmqyvlZq7psWMqKWlsZaWu7R5zJqinqtdoryzsYympqedqWLBqa3NZqmhp56ufA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./65ecf513268e3ec5438b4590-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cambio de horario 2024 en Mxico: Cundo se hace y en qu estados se realiza?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./azealia-banks-melts-down-pride-concert-miami.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Azealia Banks Melts Down at Pride Concert in Miami</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
