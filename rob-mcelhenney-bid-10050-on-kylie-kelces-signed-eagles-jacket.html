I’m getting that jacket,” McElhenney shared via <a href=# rel=noopener>X (formerly Twitter)</a> on Monday, November 20. He posted a screenshot of a message reading, “You’ve been outbid,” noting that the new highest bid on the jacket is $50,000.</p><p>Original story continues below:</p><p><a href=#><strong>Rob McElhenney</strong></a> offered up thousands of dollars for a <a href=#>special edition Philadelphia Eagles jacket</a> signed by Kylie Kelce — but he’s no longer the highest bidder.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rob-McElhenney-Bid-10050-on-Kylie-Kelce-Autographed-Philadelphia-Eagles-Jacket.jpg><p>The It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia star, 46, put down $10,050 in the auction, which launched Wednesday, November 8. “A great cause and the greatest jacket ever made? Yes please. @JasonKelce @Eagles @eaglesautism,” he <a href=# rel=noopener>tweeted</a>, sharing a screenshot that indicated he was the top bidder. (As of this writing, the leading offer is $20,000.)</p><p>The NFL team announced the auction on Wednesday while revealing the return of the “iconic ’90s Eagles Letterman Jacket” once worn by the late <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>. “We know you’ve been waiting for this one 😉,” read a tweet shared via the official Eagles account.</p><p>Fans can purchase the limited-edition varsity jacket — in the team’s throwback Kelly Green color — for $400 at the Eagles pro shop. In support of the Eagles Autism Foundation, diehard Philly supporters are bidding for the chance to win one of two jackets signed by Kelce, 31, with “Go Birds!” written on the waistband. The auction closes on November 24.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Jason Kelce</strong></a>‘s wife has become a star in her own right while cheering for the Eagles center. Kylie and Jason, 36, have been <a href=#>married since 2018</a> and share daughters Wyatt, 4, and Elliotte, 2. Their third baby girl, Bennett, now 8 months, was born days after Jason and his brother, <a href=#><strong>Travis Kelce</strong></a>, faced off against one another in Super Bowl LVII. (Travis, 34, and the Kansas City Chiefs ultimately defeated Jason and the Eagles.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rob-McElhenney-Is-the-Highest-Bidder-on-Kylie-Kelce-Signed-Eagles-Jacket.jpg><p>The couple were featured in the Prime Video documentary Kelce, which debuted in September and focused on Jason’s journey to the 2023 Super Bowl. While <a href=#>reflecting on her experience</a> as the spouse of an NFL player, Kylie told Today about wanting to stay “authentic.”</p><p>“I think there is a population of women who are married to, dating, engaged to individuals who play in the NFL or other professional sports that really, like, enjoy indulging in the finer things in life,” she said in October. “And that’s not necessarily how I was raised or what I enjoy.”</p><p>In the film, she opened up about <a href=#>her loyalty to her husband’s team</a>. “I am like an Eagles fan to the extent of, like, if Jason ever went and played for another team, I would wear ‘Kelce,’ I would not wear another team’s stuff,” Kylie — a Philly native — told the cameras. “Like, I’ve thought about that a number of times where I just couldn’t do it. It sounds terrible.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Similarly, McElhenney is a lifelong fan of Philly sports — and a vocal advocate of the Eagles repping their Kelly Green jerseys full-time. He made a public plea to Eagles owner <strong>Jeffrey Lurie</strong> after the team wore the vintage uniforms for their Week 7 game against the Miami Dolphins.</p><p>“I, along with the undersigned below via ❤️s, would like to petition you to make Kelly Green the official color of the @Eagles now and forever. Thank you for your consideration in this matter,” he tweeted on October 22.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarp5JiuqSxy6Gcp6aVrnqjtcNmaGloZWV6sLqMpLCloZViuKa4wp6qZquZnLumsIyemKCklah6q63CpJytZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./susie-essman-husband-daughter-net-worth-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Susie Essman Husband, Daughter, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./samuel-soba-s-married-life-total-mystery-known-having-keri-hilson-wife-there-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Samuel Soba's Married Life A Total Mystery?
