Given that he is to be the next king of England, the 41-year-old is always calm and composed in public. However, on a rare occasion, <a href=#>Prince William</a> gave journalist Omid Scobie a peek into the man that he is behind the curtains of royalty and public duty. The father of three admitted to shedding a few tears as his demanding work took a toll on him and he struggled to manage his duty alongside his family life.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-623580790-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-william-served-as-an-air-ambulance-pilot>Prince William served as an air ambulance pilot</h2><p>For the unversed, the former Duke of Cambridge served as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot before taking on a more public role in the monarchy. William was in the East Anglian Air Ambulance from 2015 to 2017.</p><p><a href=#>King Charles</a>‘ first son previously talked about the experience on Apple Fitness+’s&nbsp;Time to Walk&nbsp;series.&nbsp;“The moment I started the helicopter training, I realized that it was better than anything,” he said. “It was one of those things that I just instantly took to and thought, ‘This is really cool.’ I really enjoy it.”</p><p>However, doing that job for two years straight left an indelible mark on the future king of Britain. He allegedly opened up about the effect it had on his mental health to journalist and writer Omid Scobie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-480568712-1024x760.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-of-wales-confesses-to-crying-after-a-rigorous-workday>Prince of Wales confesses to crying after a ‘rigorous’ workday</h2><p>The British journalist shares in his 2023 book Endgame: Inside the Royal Family and the Monarchy’s Fight for Survival, that he had an unforgettable conversation with Prince William once. As claimed in the book, the Prince of Wales told Omid that he needed to “decompress” after a long day of work as an air ambulance pilot. It was a job that required a good mix of hard and soft skills.</p><p>“It was one of the few moments over the years I’ve witnessed a more vulnerable side of William,” the journalist notes. William told him that, after a rigorous day of work, he needed to sit at home “to decompress… watch TV or have a cry” before he could reenter his family world and be a husband to <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> and a father to their kids.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-william-recalled-a-heartbreaking-incident-at-his-previous-job>William recalled a heartbreaking incident at his previous job</h2><p><a href=#>Prince Harry</a>‘s older brother also spoke about the experience in the&nbsp;Time to Walk&nbsp;series. He said that it had him feeling like “the whole world was dying.”</p><p>He recalled how seeing families getting torn apart took a toll on him but he had to keep his head down and carry out his duties. “Seeing patients and families ripped apart on almost a daily basis, that routine, you just get into a habit of head down and get on with it,” he said.</p><p>He particularly talked about an instance when a young boy had been hit by a car. “And the parents are very hysterical, as you can imagine, screaming, wailing, not knowing what to do, you know, and, in real agony themselves. And that lives with you,” he said.</p><p>The Prince added that the boy was stabilized but he could not shake that experience off for some time.</p><p>“It hit me weeks later,” he said. “I felt like the whole world was dying. It’s an extraordinary feeling. You just feel everyone’s in pain, everyone’s suffering. And that’s not me. I’ve never felt that before.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2aAcLzRoqWcnV2stq24yJqkZquYpMSmsIyhoKxlpqq5r7HRmpmlnV2otqWxjJqbpqGkqbavs4yhnGavn6q5pXnCq7BmmZapsrN51qippGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./salma-hayek-lookalike-mom-leave-fans-doing-double-take-photo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Salma Hayek and lookalike mom leave fans doing a double take in new photo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./410973-maine-cabin-masters-cast-net-worth-salary-episode-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Maine Cabin Masters cast net worth and salary per episode</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
