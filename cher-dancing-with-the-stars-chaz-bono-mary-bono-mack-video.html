Cher got emotional after the dance -- and Chaz said it was "amazing to have her support." Check out the video above!</p><p><strong>Cher</strong> is in the house!</p><p>Last week, <strong>Chaz Bono</strong> promised fans that his mom, the one and only <strong>Cher</strong>, would attend tonight's taping of "<strong>Dancing with the Stars</strong>" if he made it through another week -- and he delivered!</p><p>The famous pop star was just seen in the audience, about 30 minutes into tonight's 2 hour show -- seated next to <strong>Courteney Cox</strong>, daughter <strong>Coco</strong> and her own mom <strong>Georgia Holt</strong> wearing one heck of a wig.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/55/o/2011/10/10/55144c9326e953469d84a9da4fc40a42_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>"On way to DWTS ! I'm very TRIBAL!" she tweeted earlier today. "Wish chaz luck!!! I'm here !" she added.</p><p>Also cheering Chaz on in the audience is <strong>Congresswoman Mary Bono Mack</strong>, who was married to <strong>Sonny Bono</strong> at the time of his death and helped raise Chaz.</p><p>Before the show, Mary tweeted "I'm excited but nervous. Can't imagine how Chaz is feeling right now!"</p><p><strong>Chynna Phillips</strong> and <strong>Tony Dovolani</strong> kicked things off on movie soundtrack-themed night with a tango to "Mission Impossible." After showing promise in the early weeks, Chynna appears to have some confidence, and fumbled with some footwork. The scored a 21/30.</p><p><strong>David Arquette</strong> and <strong>Kym Johnson</strong> performed a paso doble to "Raiders of the Lost Ark," complete with whip prop. While Phillips has been fading, Arquette has been steadily improving. His technique was sloppy at points, but judge <strong>Carrie Ann Inaba</strong> priased his new strength and charisma. They earned a solid 23/30.</p><p>You can always expect an entertaining routine from <strong>Carson Kressley</strong>, and he did not disappoint. He and <strong>Anna Trebunskaya</strong> performed a waltz to "Pirates of the Caribbean," with Kressley channeling Jack Sparrow -- guyliner included. There was some swashbuckling and even some patty-cake playing. It was more of a show than dance, so they got nailed by the judges. <strong>Len Goodman</strong> likened it to childbirth: "terrible while it's happening, joyful when it's over." They only scored a 20/30.</p><p><strong>Nancy Grace</strong> and <strong>Tristan MacManus</strong> performed a competent but bland routine to "Flash Gordon." Judge <strong>Bruno Tonioli</strong> wants her to be a ballbreaker. Unfortunately, the only excitement she's generated this season has been as a windbreaker ... allegedly. 21/30.</p><p><strong>Hope Solo</strong> and <strong>Maksim Chmerkovskiy</strong> redeemed themselves with a pleasing foxtrot from "Toy Story." Hope showed a lot more grace and fluidity than previous weeks, and Inaba said she was smiling the entire time. They earned a 24/30.</p><p>Now that's he's made it to week 4 of the competition, <strong>Rob Kardashian</strong> has officially lasted longer than his sister Kim, and has no signs of slowing down. The reality star and partner <strong>Cheryl Burke</strong> did a fun paso doble to "Superman," where Rob shed his Clark Kent-esque glasses. He's transformed into a confident dancer too -- 24/30.</p><p>The leaders two weeks in a row -- <strong>Ricki Lake</strong> and <strong>Derek Hough</strong> -- seemed to struggle in rehearsal. "I am going to have a breakdown. I just can't do it," Lake said of the pressure in the competition. "It's just very confusing for me. I am not getting it. I want to quit. Like I totally want to quit -- and I am not a quitter." Fortunately, she was able to pull it together for a suspenseful and seductive tango to "Psycho." They earned the first 10s of the season -- two, in fact -- for a total of 29/30.</p><p>As mentioned before, <strong>Chaz Bono</strong> and his partner <strong>Lacey Schwimmer </strong>performed a paso doble to "Rocky." As with the quickstep, Chaz struggled a bit to keep up with the pace of the dance, but put in his all. Cher couldn't be prouder, and Inaba is in tears routing for him. They earned 21/30, making them not the lowest scorers for the first time in two weeks.</p><p><strong>J.R. Martinez</strong> and <strong>Karina Smirnoff</strong> did a total 180 from their emotional military tribute with a fun and upbeat foxtrot from "The Pink Panther." Again, they showed some of the best technique of the night, but Inaba dinged them for a lift. They finished behind Ricki and Derek (again) with 26/30.</p><p>Who will go home tomorrow night? As last week's shocking elimination proved, anyone can go!</p><p>Tell TooFab your thoughts below.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnJ7kGlmamhfmLWmvoydmKebmaO0bsPIrZ9mrJiaerTAwKuqZpuYlsdurs6npmalkafGbq7Op6ZmpZGYuG7CyJ2cqGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chrisean-rock-wishes-not-pregnant.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chrisean Rock: I Wish I Wasnt Pregnant</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stetson-bennett.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stetson Bennett Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
