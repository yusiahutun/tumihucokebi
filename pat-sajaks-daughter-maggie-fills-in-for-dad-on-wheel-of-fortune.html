The 25-year-old joined <a href=#><strong>Vanna White</strong></a> — who is currently <a href=#>filling in as host</a> while Pat <a href=#>recovers from a November 2019 surgery</a> — to test out her chops as the guest letter-turning model.</p><p>The exciting news was first revealed in a video shared to&nbsp;Wheel of Fortune‘s <a href=#>YouTube channel</a> on Monday, January 6. Although we briefly saw Pat return,&nbsp;he explained&nbsp;this absence is due to&nbsp;“the technicalities of the show”&nbsp;and how it’s filmed,&nbsp;“not because of a relapse.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/vanna-white-maggie-sajak.png><p>The video of the proud dad — who shares Maggie, as well as son Patrick Sajak, 29, with his longtime wife, <a href=#><strong>Lesly Brown</strong></a> — then cut to the Vanna, 62, as she walked onto the&nbsp;Wheel of Fortune&nbsp;stage to introduce the exciting new guest.</p><p>“As you just heard, Pat will be back next week. In the meantime, I’m happy to fill in,” the beloved TV personality said in the preview. “But, you know, I could do this even better hosting the show with a Sajak. Everyone, please welcome Pat’s daughter, Maggie Sajak.”</p><p>As the blonde beauty took the stage in a stunning red minidress, she was immediately greeted with cheers and applause. As she chatted with Vanna, Maggie said while it was a “scary experience” regarding her dad’s emergency surgery to correct a blocked intestine, she assured fans he was doing “great.”</p><p>At the end of the show, Maggie and Vanna returned to the center of the stage and the two reflected on Pat’s daughter’s first-ever appearance on Wheel of Fortune in 1996. After a clip of baby Maggie making her game show debut alongside her dad played out, she joked she’s hopefully “a little more eloquent than last time.” We think Maggie did fantastic!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/vanna-white-hosts-wheel-of-fortune-for-pat-sajak.jpg><p>Maggie’s guest appearance on her dad’s iconic game show — which he’s been hosting since 1982 — comes weeks after Pat shared the <a href=#>news of his emergency surgery</a> on November 7. Although fans missed the former&nbsp;Pat Sajak Show star, they couldn’t have been happier to have his costar <a href=#>fill in</a> during his time off.</p><p>“You know, I’m getting some great feedback,” Vanna exclusively told Closer Weekly in early November, noting that she was a little terrified about <a href=#>filling in such big shoes</a>. “It did get easier as the shows went on,” she added. “I was just kind of thrown into it. It was a lot to comprehend to carry a show, and I’m a very shy person anyway and don’t really talk a lot. So to have to carry the show <a href=#>was kind of scary</a>.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46pmK1lo5a3orfSZpuarZedwaa%2BjKaYoJ%2BZmnqntculqmahnmKzsL6MnZidZZ%2Bjeri0xJ6jZqeWYrOwvtOupZ5n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pixi-beauty-fortifeye-eye-patches-review-7108343.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>These Collagen Eye Patches Brighten My Dark Circles In 10 Minutes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marisa-millers-amazing-skin-secrets.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Marisa Miller Shares Her Amazing Skin Secrets</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
