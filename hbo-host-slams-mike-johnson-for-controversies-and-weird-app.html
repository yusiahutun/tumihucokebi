On the latest episode of “Last Week Tonight,” the host, John Oliver, opened with a monologue roasting the speaker for several reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, since his appointment in October, a lot has been revealed about him. These include his anti-LGBTQ+ beliefs and his alleged involvement in trying to overturn the 2020 elections. Therefore, Johnson has been under much scrutiny for most of his tenure.&nbsp;</p><p>While starting the monologue, Oliver mentioned that Johnson “continued to remind everyone that beneath his mild-mannered exterior lurks a far-right conservative.” Looking at his public association with Trump, it is easy to see why the HBO host thinks so.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Speaker Mike Johnson Visits Trump Amid Growing Criticism</a></strong></p><p>Another controversial moment Oliver noted was Johnson’s announcement that he would make about 44,000 hours of footage from the Capitol riots available to the public. However, he later stated that his office blurred the faces of these people. This caused an uproar among the public, but Johnson claimed he protected them from “retaliation.”</p><p>Oliver continued, saying, “If there was any hope Johnson might moderate his views now that he’s speaker, that is gone.” He also briefly spoke about Johnson’s apparent anti-LGBTQ+ stance. In the past week alone, the speaker made bold moves, further showing his opposition. He also accepted an award at a Christian gala where most speakers had terrible things to say about the community.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, one of them claimed that “homosexuality is three times worse than smoking.” In response to this, Oliver joked, “The only thing a smoking habit and someone’s sexuality have in common is that they could both be strongly influenced by this picture of Joe Camel.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#><strong>POLL — Should the Government Increase Taxes on the Wealthy To Reduce Economic Inequality?</strong></a></p><p>The host continued, saying, “Because there was so little vetting before Johnson became speaker, we keep discovering new unsettling facts about him.” Another unsettling fact Oliver mentioned was that Johnson and his teenage son use an app called Covenant Eyes to “monitor each other’s internet browsing for porn.”</p><p>Without a doubt, this is alarming news and quite unusual behavior. “If Mike Johnson’s son is watching this, I’m sorry. Your dad seems like a lot. And if he is watching this online, I guess Mike probably is, too. Hi Mike! You must’ve gotten that alert after we showed the picture of the camel,” Oliver said.&nbsp;</p><p>The “Last Week Tonight” host also had his two cents on the app. He criticized the logo and its ads for their odd and weirdly suggestive nature. He doubled back on Johnson’s anti-LGBTQ+ stance, citing how he endorsed a book containing several slurs and racist remarks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ALSO READ:</strong> <a href=#><strong>Controversy as House Speaker Mike Johnson Likened Abortion to Holocaust</strong></a></p><p>However, the speaker had publicly denied this before, stating that he “strongly disagrees” with the book’s message. This contradicts his actions, as he promoted the book on his podcast when it came out. He said, “I obviously believe in the product, or I wouldn’t have written the foreword. So, I endorse the work.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Oliver also had much more to say about the speaker, his son, and his involvement with Trump. However, he concluded his segment by saying, “I’m sure that’s not the last upsetting revelation we’re gonna get about him, but it’s too late. He’s already the speaker.”</p><p><strong>You might Also Like</strong>:</p><p><a href=#>The Supreme Court Rules in Favor of an 83-year-old Woman in a Case of Manhandling By California Police</a></p><p><a href=#>Alex Jones Admits that He May Go Obsolete Soon During a Recent Interview</a></p><p><a href=#>Chauvin Incident Sparks Concerns Over Federal Prison Safety</a></p><p><a href=#>Adrian Monk Makes a Surprise Comeback, and It May Be His Final Goodbye</a></p><p><a href=#>Hunter Biden Indicted For Failing to Pay Taxes While Spending Millions on a Lavish Lifestyle</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktaO7jKGmrKxdqLmiudJmpKKjlWK3sLTNrKanZZakv26vzqerq6emmr%2B0tcSsZJqmlGLEprXRnWSaqKBk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./65c684e8268e3eca428b45ef-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jordania vs. Qatar en vivo dnde ver, a qu hora es en Mxico y pronstico Final Copa Asitica</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./a-guide-to-flowers-for-sagittarius.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>A Guide to Flowers for Sagittarius</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
