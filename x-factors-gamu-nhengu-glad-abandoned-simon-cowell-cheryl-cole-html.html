Indeed she had seemed to be one of the very strongest contenders with her powerful voice.<br></span></p><p><span>But Cher Lloyd, who snuffled and trembled through her song, laid low with a throat infection, was preferred. Gamu says that at the time she was completely dumbstruck and believed that her dreams of making it as a singer were at an end. She wept for weeks.</span></p><p><span>Now she says she feels that the rejection makes sense and she understands that it might be possible to make it as a singer without being an X Factor artist.</span></p><p><span>She tells me: ‘I can see now why it happened. I didn’t have the right street image like Cher. I just didn’t fit the bill for Cheryl.<br></span></p><p><span>'It’s not easy but I understand that it’s a competition and that is the way it goes. I hold no ill feeling.’<br></span></p><p><span>Although Gamu was told in the initial weeks after losing out that many major record labels wanted to sign her up, nothing came of it. Instead she has watched as her peers on the show release records.</span></p><span>‘I can see now why it happened. I didn’t have the right street image like Cher. I just didn’t fit the bill for Cheryl.'<br></span><span><span style=font-style:italic></span></span><br><span></span><p><span>She was, like all contestants, compelled to sign a management agreement with the company which manages all X Factor artists, which meant that she could be kept in obscurity by the Cowell machine.</span></p><p><span>John Richardson says: ‘They tell them to sit there and shut up. I think that for six months she was basically waiting for something to happen.<br></span></p><p><span>'We sent her management dozens of emails and didn’t get a single response. We had a proposal which would have netted her £25,000 but we didn’t hear a peep back.</span></p><p><span>‘Earlier this year Gamu asked to be released, and now at last she is free.’</span></p><p><span>Since escaping the clutches of the show she has got a publishing deal, and a record deal, and has spent the past couple of months in the studio making an album.</span></p><p><span>About half of the songs are written by her, and she describes them as ‘pretty old school, with a very classic Motown feel’.</span></p><p><span>One of her collaborators is Lamont Dozier, a Motown legend who wrote for The Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas and the Four Tops. He has written a song for her, which is quite a coup.<br></span></p><p><span>The album should be released in March next year. It’s a long time, of course, since October 2010 when she was big news, but Gamu’s big break might finally be about to arrive.<br></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmlpbmhthXd7t2Z9mpukpL%2B0eaaapK5lfp2yr7PUZp6lmZRirqOtzZ2mp52UYqCquc6nZHynp5q5rXmioZyrsZxikLC4xGefraWc</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./414127-cancer-day-quotes-messages-wishes-fighters-survivors-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cancer day quotes, messages, and wishes for fighters and survivors</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./page.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Online Fashion Magazine | Free Fashion Magazine</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
