We take a look into what was discussed between the two on The Viall Files.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/07/GettyImages-1252532529-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>JoJo Siwa reveals ‘hardest thing’ about being in the public eye</h2><p>After being famous since such a young age, JoJo, who recently <a href=#>welcomed a new addition</a> to the family, opened up on the ‘hardest thing’ about being a <a href=#>celebrity</a>.</p><p>“I think for me, the hardest thing is people looking at my life as if I’m a character, and if they can throw anything at at. But at the end of the day, I’m a human.</p><p>It never really affected me until I started getting into relationships, because then it started to affect another person that I really loved and cared deeply about. That got really tricky for me to try and figure out how to balance,” the star continued.</p><p>Siwa then explained that she was fine with it because she knew it was just “what it is,” however, the person that she’s with, doesn’t have the same feeling. Especially if they’re not in the public eye, like her first girlfriend.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-recalls-coming-out-to-the-world>The star recalls coming out to the world</h2><p>The Dance Moms star first came out in January 2021 and has opened up about the process of coming out privately, and publically.</p><p>She explained coming out both personally and publically as “quite easy” however, questioned if it was the right decision after making the announcement publically on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>The process of coming out to her family came after JoJo began hanging out with a girl. Her mom then asked if she liked her as a friend or “more than a friend” to which, she figured.</p><p>The star then revealed that her dad gave her a high 5 while shouting “No pregnancy scares!”</p><p>Publically, JoJo posted a picture with a shirt saying “best gay cousin ever.” She revealed she didn’t expect the ‘crazy’ response, calling it “very very overwhelming” making her question if it was the right choice.</p><p>The <a href=#>music</a> star also opened up about some corporations telling her she made the wrong choice, and ‘shouldn’t be’ telling her young demographic that she’s gay, saying she was “shunned”.</p><p>On the matter, JoJo said she “doesn’t want to represent something that doesn’t support what I love,” in regards to losing fans and corporations.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>JoJo speaks on Candace Cameron Bure ‘feud’</h2><p>The 20-year-old also opened up on the status of her ‘feud’ with <a href=#>Hollywood</a> actress Candace Cameron Bure which began after JoJo’s <a href=#>TikTok</a> went viral after showing the “rudest celeb,” in a quick flash. However, of course, social media investigators figured out who it was.</p><p>JoJo said she ‘didn’t think much’ of the video, and explained the story that she didn’t take a pic with her when she was 11 years old at The Fuller House premiere. Candace then apologized and all seemed good again, with JoJo saying she “learned from the lesson” on what she posts in the future.</p><p>However, Candance then faced backlash after her comments about prioritizing portraying “traditional marriage,” which Siwa called her out on.</p><p>She’s now told Nick she accepts the two will never “get on” or “be friends” but just wishes the actress could be “a little more open.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlvX2eEcLbOo6Zmq5msrm6%2FwLKqZqCRp7Gmv9Nmq6Ghnpx6oq7OrqtmmpWeu6h5xZqkqK2jYrW2vtOsZKmdn6W5pnnSoZxmpJ%2BrsrR506imaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ford-amphitheatre-noise-dispute-battles-on.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ford Amphitheatre Noise Dispute Battles On</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./emma-bunton-discusses-split-from-soulmate-jade-jones.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Emma Bunton discusses benefits of split from 'soulmate' Jade Jones</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
