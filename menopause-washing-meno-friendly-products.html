"I was 48 and at the height of my career, travelling the world for work. One morning I woke up with a chronic bout of anxiety and I couldn't leave for the airport, and that was just an unbelievable experience for me.

But Sam's experience made her realise that there was a serious lack of signposting from retailers about products that would help her during the period.</p><p id=ekT1myN6A-EW data-wc=61>"The more I looked, the more I just couldn't find products to support me and I started to get frustrated," Sam says. Her frustration prompted Sam to team up with her co-founder, Heather Jackson, to launch GenM, with the view to bring responsible organisations together to help them understand the menopausal audience and do more to support them through the transition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2e9ca31051fb-sam-heather.jpg><p id=elFhv0cV5Ret data-wc=33>Sam wanted other women to be able to easily find products, be it on the supermarket shelves or when shopping online, that could help them, because when women thrive, society thrives, she says.</p><p id=eJNVWmLCmxZf data-wc=11><strong>&nbsp;INSPIRATION:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Why does nobody talk about the incredible positives of menopause?</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eliBvBU9xKrN data-wc=31>As part of GenM's efforts, they launched the MTick, the world's first menopause-friendly symbol, to signpost products that have been rigorously tested and are genuinely helpful to those going through perimenopause.</p><p id=e06K3cJWrqWs data-wc=48>"The MTick is the brainchild of Heather and myself, backed by research," Sam explains. Products awarded the MTick must meet GenM's criteria and provide the data to verify that it does what it claims. Brands are denied the tick if they don't meet the standard, and can reapply.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c702c44d8714-meno-tick.png><p id=ebetY46hzJ-Q data-wc=42>GenM's research showed there was a demand for the tick, with 80% of women saying they wanted to shop products labelled ‘menopause-friendly’, and 66% saying that a lack of clear signposting made it hard for them to find the products they need.</p><p id=e9hoO0fVDljN data-wc=14><strong>&nbsp;READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>I'm a menopause wellness coach and this is what helped me through menopause</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e61QZgTF4lRw data-wc=25>The MTick also works towards ending the stigma of meno-washing; the idea that brands are claiming their products are menopause-friendly, just to rake in profits.</p><p id=eGTV4cw50kR1 data-wc=47>"I think meno-washing is rubbish, and all it does is detract from the goodness the product could give to the user," Sam says.
