While we have seen extended members of the family on the balcony in previous years, it's likely that King Charles and <a class=hm-link href=#>Queen Camilla</a> will only be joined by working members of the royal family on this occasion, keeping in line with last year's event and the recent coronation.&nbsp;</p><p id=errnp_Xx9l data-wc=44>Therefore, we can expect to see the likes of the Prince and <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess of Wales</a> and their three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, and the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, and their kids, Lady Louise Windsor, and James, Earl of Wessex.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: George, Charlotte and Louis make carriage debut at Trooping the Colour 2022</figure><p id=em0VESnZd7dv data-wc=12>First things first though, why does the King celebrate his birthday twice?</p><h2>Trooping the Colour: history and name explained</h2><p id=eTuUagO-mPp7 data-wc=28>His Majesty celebrates two birthdays: his actual birthday on 14 November and his official birthday on the second Saturday of June at Trooping the Colour â€“ but why?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c5a84a52a618-prince-charles-teary-at-trooping-z.jpg><p id=eaCyG11GyrJ4 data-wc=45>Historically, official celebrations to mark a sovereign's birthday have often been held on a day other than their birthday. This is usually true when their actual birthday does not land in the summer months. The reason, in typical British fashion, comes down to the weather.</p><p id=eODvZxK4VXl3 data-wc=37>The tradition started in 1748 with George II, who was born in chilly November. Instead of risking his subjects catching a cold, he combined his birthday celebration with the annual spring parade known as Trooping the Colour.</p><h2>Why is it called Trooping the Colour?</h2><p id=eznqWr5Ex-hw data-wc=41>'Colours' refers to the flags that represent the different regiments in the British Army. The army used these flags so that soldiers could spot their unit on the battlefield. 'Trooping', meanwhile, refers to the marching up and down of the troops.&nbsp;</p><p id=ecVkZq67LXoM data-wc=39>Trooping the Colour therefore refers to when the flags of the different regiments are displayed. Each year, a different regiment is chosen to 'troop' their 'colour' and 2022's event saw the colour trooped by the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards.</p><h2>What is Trooping the Colour?</h2><p id=eR5aXH3CrBnp data-wc=29>Over 1,400 parading soldiers, 200 horses and 400 musicians come together each June in a great display of military precision, horsemanship and fanfare to mark the King's official birthday.</p><p id=e6s6U-f3HlSu data-wc=12><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Royally stylish: Duchess Kate's best Trooping The Colour outfits since 2011</a></strong></p><p id=ewJ6Nnn6feUa data-wc=11><strong>MORE:<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;9 cheekiest balcony moments from royal children at Buckingham Palace</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/02f00a292d3c-the-mall-trooping-the-colour-z.jpg><p id=eEbNU7JXd_nK data-wc=34>The streets are lined with crowds waving flags as the parade moves from Buckingham Palace and down The Mall to Horse Guard's Parade, alongside members of the royal family on horseback and in carriages.&nbsp;</p><p id=etHISzXN6rLw data-wc=40>Shutterstock's royal photographer Tim Rooke, who has been capturing the royals for over 25 years, previously told<strong>&nbsp;HELLO!</strong> in 2021 that he captured some of the <strong>"nicest family photos"</strong> at the 2019 ceremony, where Prince Louis made his adorable debut.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c4e78aab325b-louis-charlotte-trooping-the-colour-z.jpg><p id=ebDcuYoArtM_ data-wc=33>He's even managed to capture some incredible off-duty photos of Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Louis with their royal nanny before the Queen and her family assemble on the balcony at Buckingham Palace.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/66c336d24676-cambridges-trooping-2019-z.jpg><p id=eValeEIX9m5 data-wc=56>He said: "Some of the kids were in the window of Buckingham Palace waiting with their nanny, watching as the [then] Duke and Duchess of Cambridge came back, so that made some quite fun pictures, and then once they're back, then they all come out on the balcony, so it made some very nice family pictures."</p><h2>What is the history behind Trooping the Colour?</h2><p id=eXsYwUG0XUWj data-wc=29>According to the Household Division, the British Army's regimental flags were historically described as 'colours' because they display the uniform and insignia of the soldiers from different military units</p><p id=eSZiOpT1DLmx data-wc=31>The army used these flags so that soldiers could easily spot their unit when they were on the battlefield because it used to be quite easy to get lost in battle.&nbsp;</p><p id=ep-_D_rdU9la data-wc=34>Officers would regularly march up and down in front of soldiers, known as 'trooping,' with their flags on displays, known as 'colours' so that everyone would know which ones would belong to which regiment.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b9f699a5b726-queen-philip-trooping-z.jpg><p id=e3LnuZVkBT-p data-wc=16>The royals have mostly stuck to tradition when it comes to the format of the ceremony.&nbsp;</p><p id=elxZ5fPNIG data-wc=61>Tim said: "What used to happen was the Queen would go down to Horseguards Parade and then the other members of the royal family would come back and go into the palace and the Queen would stand outside the gates of the palace and review the soldiers as they marched past, and the Duke of Edinburgh would stand next to her."</p><p id=en8sPvlw8CFj data-wc=32>While the press pack of photographers take up their official position on the Queen Victoria Memorial in front of Buckingham Palace, Tim reveals there's also another key spot to capture the royals.</p><p id=e1lLujLAQ7nB data-wc=67>He told <strong>HELLO!</strong>: "One of the nicest pictures that you can get is if you stand on The Mall outside Clarence House because all the staff come out and wait outside. When the carriages come from the palace, there's interaction between the members of the royal family between staff and friends, who stand outside Clarence House, so actually that makes a better picture than the official position."</p><h2>Who attends Trooping the Colour?</h2><p id=eY6v8kQqpz84 data-wc=40>Members of His Majesty's family attend, including his siblings, <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Anne</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Edward</a>, and their respective spouses, as well as the late Queen Elizabeth's II's cousins, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, the Duke of Kent and Princess Alexandra.&nbsp;</p><p id=eCXHvJcYwJj1 data-wc=25>In recent years, we've seen <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince George</a>, <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Charlotte</a> and Prince Louis, make their debuts at the event, alongside their cousins, Savannah and Isla Phillips.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/72b4570d3005-savannah-prince-george-trooping-z.jpg><p id=ej4-Ss__GXs0 data-wc=29>George and Savannah had one of the most memorable moments at Trooping the Colour in 2018 when Savannah put her hand over her cousin's mouth to stop him singing.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3yFoY4cddXm data-wc=30>With the eyes of the world upon them, the royal children have proved they're just like any other kids with their cheeky antics and their awe-struck expressions during the fly-past.</p><p id=eedkbsSldF data-wc=16>The Wales children also made their <a class=hm-link href=#>debut in the carriage procession</a> at Trooping the Colour 2022.&nbsp;</p><h2>What do the royals wear to Trooping the Colour?</h2><p id=eu0VZ7UywOT3 data-wc=41>Fashion is always a talking point of any major royal event and the Princess of Wales often turns to her go-to designer, Alexander McQueen, for her outfits, beginning with a cream ruffled ensemble for her debut at the event in 2011.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ea419aefceea-kate-middleton-meghan-markle-trooping-z.jpg><p id=e_lckvFtc-8r data-wc=48>Before stepping back as a senior royal, the <a class=hm-link href=#>Duchess of Sussex</a> appeared at the ceremony twice, opting for a stunning blush pink off-the-shoulder dress from Carolina Herrera in 2018 and a navy and white number, designed by her wedding dress designer, Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy in 2019.</p><p id=e_vbkNMiPBk4 data-wc=32>The royal children's outfits also get plenty of attention, with Kate and the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Duchess of Edinburgh</a> turning to traditional labels such as British brand, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Rachel Riley</a>, for outfits for their little ones. &nbsp;</p><p id=e4DpQ0-I1Bb5 data-wc=39><a class=hm-link href=#>Lady Louise Windsor</a> has been seen in several of Rachel Riley's classic pieces at Trooping the Colour over the years, including a mauve and yellow printed dress with a Peter Pan collar under a matching scalloped cardigan in 2012.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0abe1b289210-lady-louise-windsor-trooping-2012-z.jpg><p id=eQM0hXI5v8e5 data-wc=24>"It makes me feel really proud, I'm a small business owner and it makes me feel part of British history," Rachel previously told <strong>HELLO!</strong></p><p id=eQpOuW-a8mAD data-wc=48>"On those formal occasions like when the royal family are on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, I think it's important to make sure their children are wearing timeless and classic designs that really won't show their age in future and in photographs that won't represent a specific time."</p><p id=ezulx60so5W3 data-wc=50>Throughout the decades, the royals have been known to borrow their siblings' clothes or pass down outfits from generation to generation; in the case of Louis, he wore a blue and white two-piece that once belonged to his father, William, and uncle, <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Harry</a>, at his Trooping the Colour debut.</p><h2>When was the first Trooping the Colour?</h2><p id=eChHn01FCvel data-wc=58>The first Trooping the Colour ceremony is believed to have originated during the reign of King Charles II from 1660 to 1685.
