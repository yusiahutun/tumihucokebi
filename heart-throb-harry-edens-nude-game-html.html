Walsh told him about the role of the young Daniel Craig.</p><p>'Then he said: "Do you mind doing sex scenes and not having any clothes on?" I wasn't going to say no, was I?' Harry chirped.</p><p>Twelve months later, Walsh called and told Harry the job was his. Harry later met with Daniel over a drink to get the measure of the man.</p><p>Harry knows his way around a film set, having shot his first movie, Pure, with Keira Knightley, when he was just 11. He played the son of a drug addict. I remember the night he won a British Independent Film Award for that moving performance.</p><p>Later, he did another drama called Real Men, where he played a boy who was being abused.</p><p>Other roles include Jo in the brilliant Bleak House and the Artful Dodger in Roman Polanski's Oliver Twist. His performances seemed to be informed with a knowledge of what it's really like to be ill-treated, and Harry believes that could be because his parents foster children who often come from damaged backgrounds.</p><p>'I sometimes talk to the children about what happened to them, but I had no idea it was influencing some of my work,' Harry told me.</p><p>Flashbacks Of A Fool, an astute drama which - be warned - features a moment that will pierce your heart, marks Harry as a young actor with leading man qualities.</p><p>He has a sensitivity and a certain dash about him that's likely to turn him into a heartthrob, although he's not that interested in all that stuff. He'd rather be playing golf.</p><p>Harry had fun shooting on locations in South Africa (although the film's set in the UK and Hollywood), but admits he was worried about the steamy love scenes with Jodhi May.</p><p>'They changed the schedule and we did the sex scenes straight away. I was nervous, I didn't know anyone and I was naked. 'Jodhi and I talked about it and we started off kissing, then by the end of the day when we knew each other a bit, we started doing it,' Harry told me, blushing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJufocKuusisq6xnkafBqq%2FLnmRubGdugHN7p56Yq6xdqbWzu8Fmf5qqoq56hrDEp6pmpqWZsm6zwKacZ6Ckork%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./beyonce-neon-flowing-neon-green-gown-attached-hood-renaissance-tour.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>See Beyonc Look Gorgeous in a Flowing Neon Green Gown and Attached Hood</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hank-williams-jr-songs.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hank Williams Jr Songs, Net Worth, Wife, Kids, Age, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-haunting-of-hill-house-questions-answers-theories-netflix-season-2-mike-flanagan.html>'Haunting of Hill House' Questions, Answers and Theories on Our Mind</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./message-private-account-on-instagram.html>How to Message a Private Account on Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./palmers-swivel-stick.html>Palmer's $9 Swivel Stick Eases Dry Flakes, Peeling Lips &amp;amp; Acne Scars</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-burks-house.html>The Burks House Laurel Mercantile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-positive-impact-of-gyming-on-mental-health.html>The Positive Impact of Gyming on Mental Health: Strengthening Body and Mind</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog.
