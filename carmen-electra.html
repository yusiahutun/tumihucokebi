Her Marriage & Dating History</h2><p>Baywatch's actress <strong>Carmen Electra</strong> is possibly single right now. But, it wasn't like this for the actress, who was first married to her boyfriend, a NBA star named <strong>Dennis Rodman</strong>. On those days, Electra needed emotional support because of the continuous demise of her mother and sister. She once admitted Rodman was a fun person to be around.&nbsp;</p><strong><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/05/24/carmen-electra-and-her-first-husband-dennis-rodman--1590308262.jpg width=450 height=253 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class=imageCaption>Carmen Electra and her first husband, Dennis Rodman. </span></strong><span class=imageSource><strong>SOURCE: Yahoo! Sports</strong></span><p>Talking about her married life, Carmen tied the knot with the NBA star at Little Chapel of the Flowers, Las Vegas, in November 1998. Believe it or not, it was just nine days of their wedding when the basketball player filed their marriage as an annulment, claiming that he was of 'unsound mind' at the time of their wedding. However, the pair reunited and celebrated New Years' eve together in December. Four months later, the two finally divorced in April 1999 under mutual agreement.</p><p>But the story of Electra and Rodman wasn't meant to be over, believe it or not, the former couple was arrested in a Maimi hotel for misdemeanor battery. Later, they were bailed on <strong>$2,500</strong> each and ordered the two not to have any contact. However, their charges had been eventually dropped. To tell you the truth, Carmen has recently posted some old pictures of the athlete. It seems that the two are good friends now even after having off and on relationship in the late 90s.</p><p>Four years later, Electra and Rodman split up, she shared the wedding vows with <a href=# rel=noopener>Dave Navarro</a> on November 22, 2003. Speaking of her second husband, Navarro is a lead guitarist for the rock band, Jane's Addiction. As a matter of fact, their wedding was broadcasted in an MTV reality show called Til Death Do Us Part: Carmen and Dave.&nbsp;</p><strong><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/05/24/carmen-electra-and-her-second-husband-dave-navarro--1590308403.jpg width=450 height=611 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class=imageCaption>Carmen Electra and her second husband, Dave Navarro. </span></strong><span class=imageSource><strong>SOURCE: Pinterest</strong></span><p>Almost after three years, the MTV host and rockstar announced getting a divorce on July 17, 2006. Later, Carmen filed a divorce on August 10, 2006, which was finalized on February 20, 2007. A year then, she exchanged the rings with <strong>Rob Patterson</strong> in April 2008. Patterson is a guitarist of the rock band called Filter. Although she remained engaged for many years, they didn't marry.</p><strong><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/05/24/the-actress-carmen-electra-captured-with-her-former-partner-rob-patterson--1590308576.jpg width=450 height=675 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class=imageCaption>The actress Carmen Electra captured with her former partner, Rob Patterson. </span></strong><span class=imageSource><strong>SOURCE: Zimbio</strong></span><p>In 2012, she showed up as one of the bachelor celebrity on the dating show, The Choice. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Daily Mail UK</a>, she was reported dating the TV star, <a href=# rel=noopener>Simone Cowell</a>, from December 2012 to next February. Even though the playboy model had been with several men, she never gave birth to a child. Most probably, she prefers to live a free life.</p><h2>Professional Career</h2><p>Electra started her career in 1990 as a dancer in the show "It's Magic" at Kings Island in Mason, Ohio. She then began a short singing stint with her first single "Go Dancer" in 1992. She released her second single "Everyone Get on Up" after a year, and another one in 1993, called "Capriccio Erotica."</p><strong><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/05/24/carmen-electra-as-a-life-guard-in-baywatch--1590308793.jpg width=450 height=707 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class=imageCaption>Carmen Electra as a lifeguard in Baywatch. </span></strong><span class=imageSource><strong>SOURCE: PopSugar</strong></span><p>Carmen made her 1997 television debut, starring in American Vampire. Nonetheless, when she was featured in a nude pictorial at Playboy magazine in May 1996, she increased her popularity. Electra got her big break in films with a role in the 2000 horror movie called "Scary Movie." She returned to Baywatch in 2003 for the get-together movie Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding. In fact, Electra turned up for Best Kiss during the 1970s television series Starsky and Hutch, for which she received the 2004 MTV Movie Award.</p><h2>How much Does Carmen Electra Worth?</h2><p>The 48 years old has an estimated networth of <strong>$8 million</strong> as of 2020.
